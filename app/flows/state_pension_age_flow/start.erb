Your State Pension age is the earliest age you can start receiving your State Pension. It may be different to the age you can get a [workplace or personal pension](/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).  

Use this tool to check: 

- when you'll reach State Pension age
- your Pension Credit qualifying age
- when you'll be eligible for free bus travel

^The State Pension age is regularly reviewed, so the results of this tool may change in the future. You can [read about the launch of the latest review of State Pension age](/government/collections/third-state-pension-age-review).^
