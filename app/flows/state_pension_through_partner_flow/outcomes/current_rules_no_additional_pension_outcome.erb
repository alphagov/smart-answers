  You might be able to increase the amount of [basic State Pension](/state-pension) to <%= calculator.lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> per week if:

  - your spouse or civil partner has enough National Insurance contributions
  - your spouse or civil partner was born on or after 6 April 1950 (this rule doesn’t apply to you if you’re a woman married to a man, or if you’re a woman married to a woman who legally changed their gender from male to female after the marriage began)

  One of the following must also apply:

  - you don’t qualify for any basic State Pension
  - your basic State pension is less than <%= calculator.lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> per week  

  You’ll normally have got the increase when either you or your spouse or civil partner reached State Pension age, whichever was later.  If you think you qualify but you’re not getting the increase, contact [The Pension Service](/contact-pension-service).

  ##If you become widowed or your civil partner dies

  You may be able to increase your basic State Pension up to <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if:

  - your own basic State Pension is less than <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week
  - your late spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions

  You may also inherit a portion of their [Additional State-Pension](/additional-state-pension) and a portion of any [State Pension top up](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/top-up-your-state-pension). If they had [put off claiming their State Pension](/deferring-state-pension/tax-and-inheritance) you may inherit a portion of their deferral payment. You may also inherit half their Graduated Retirement Benefit (the earnings-related State Pension people could build up between 1961 and 1975).

  ##If you get divorced or your civil partnership is dissolved

  You may be able to increase your basic State Pension up to <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if:

  - your own [basic State Pension](/state-pension) is less than <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %>
  - your former spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions

  The courts may award you a share of your former spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension as part of your settlement.
