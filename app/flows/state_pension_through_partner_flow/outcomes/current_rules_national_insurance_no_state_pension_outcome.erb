  You might be able to increase the amount of [basic State Pension](/state-pension) to <%= calculator.lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> per week if:

  - your spouse or civil partner made enough National Insurance contributions before 6 April 2016
  - your spouse or civil partner was born on or after 6 April 1950 (this rule doesn’t apply to you if you’re a woman married to a man, or if you’re a woman married to a woman who legally changed their gender after the marriage)

  One of the following must also apply:

  - you don’t qualify for any basic State Pension
  - your basic State pension is less than <%= calculator.lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> per week

  You’ll get the increase when your spouse or civil partner reaches [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).

  You may be able to increase your [basic State Pension](/state-pension) up to <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if:

  - your own basic State Pension is less than <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week
  - your late spouse or civil partner made enough National Insurance contributions before 6 April 2016

  You may also inherit some of their [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension) based on their contributions up to 5 April 2016 and half their Graduated Retirement Benefit (the earnings-related State Pension between 1961 and 1975).

  ##If you get divorced or your civil partnership is dissolved

  You may be able to increase your [basic State Pension](/state-pension) up to <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if:

  - your own basic State Pension is less than <%= calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week
  - your former spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions before 6 April 2016
