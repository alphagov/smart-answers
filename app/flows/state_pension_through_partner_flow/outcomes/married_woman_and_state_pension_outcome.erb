  Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.

  Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:

  - you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate
  - you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed

  This is also known as the [married women’s reduced rate election](/reduced-national-insurance-married-women) (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).

  ^Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.^

  The reduced rate election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.

  **Example**

  You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2026. This is in the tax year 6 April 2025 to 5 April 2026.

  You got married in 1975 and chose to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.

  Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in the tax year 6 April 1990 to 5 April 1991.

  ##What you may get if you have a reduced rate election
  
  You won’t need to have the usual minimum of 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get a State Pension.

  You’ll get a pension of about <%= format_money(calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate) %> a week plus any Additional State Pension and Graduated Retirement Benefit you built up before 6 April 2016.

  <%= format_money(calculator.higher_basic_state_pension_rate) %> is the maximum rate of basic State Pension a widowed person who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 can get through their spouse or civil partner’s National Insurance record.

  You’ll get this when you’re widowed or when you [claim your State Pension](/deferring-state-pension/tax-and-inheritance), if later.

  You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

  ###If you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age

  You’ll get a pension of about <%= format_money(calculator.lower_basic_state_pension_rate) %> a week plus any Additional State Pension and Graduated Retirement Benefit you built up before 6 April 2016.

  You’ll get this when either you or your new spouse or civil partner reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age), whichever is later.

  If your new spouse or civil partner reaches State Pension age after you, you’ll get your State Pension based on your own National Insurance contributions until they reach State Pension age.

  <%= format_money(calculator.lower_basic_state_pension_rate) %> is the maximum rate of basic State Pension a married person or civil partner who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 can get through their spouse or civil partner’s National Insurance record.

  If your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions, you’ll get that instead.

  You may be able to inherit some of your late spouse or civil partner’s State Pension. What you get depends on when they reached or would have reached State Pension age and when your marriage or civil partnership began.
