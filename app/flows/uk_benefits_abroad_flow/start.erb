  Find out which UK benefits you might be able to get while you're abroad and how to claim them if you're eligible.

  The UK has social security agreements with some countries that:

  - allow you to claim some benefits while you're there
  - mean that your National Insurance contributions can count towards your eligibility for that country's benefits

  It's easier to organise benefits before you leave.
