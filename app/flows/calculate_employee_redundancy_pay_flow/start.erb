  Redundancy payments are based on age, weekly pay and number of years in the job.

  Your employee's weekly pay is the average they earned per week over the 12 weeks before the day they got their redundancy notice.

  ^Your employee has 6 months from the date their job ends to apply for statutory redundancy pay.

  Employees only qualify if they’ve worked at least 2 full years for you.
