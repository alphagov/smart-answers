  Paying by cheque
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  You can only pay by cheque if you’re exempt from submitting online VAT returns. If you need to pay by cheque for any other reason, pay by Bank Giro.

  The last day you can post your cheque is <%= calculator.last_payment_date.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>.

  Your cheque must have cleared by <%= calculator.funds_received_by.to_fs(:govuk_date) %>.

  ^The date your cheque clears is the day when your payment reaches HMRC’s account. It’s not the day when they get your cheque in the post.^
