    ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025

    You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta) to come to the UK if you already have one.

    All of the following must apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 14 October 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025
    * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

    ###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK 

    You’ll usually need a Standard Visitor visa to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:  

    * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 14 October 2025
    * you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025

    ## What you can and cannot do with an ETA

    You can visit the UK on holiday or to spend time with family and friends.

    You can also do [other permitted activities as a Standard Visitor](/standard-visitor).

    While in the UK as a tourist, you cannot:

    - do paid or unpaid work for a UK company or as a self-employed person
    - claim [public funds](/government/publications/public-funds--2) (benefits)
    - live in the UK for long periods of time through frequent or successive visits
    - marry or register a civil partnership, or give notice of marriage or civil partnership. You’ll need a [Marriage Visitor visa](/marriage-visa) instead

    ## What you need at the UK border if you have an ETA

    You must provide a valid passport or travel document. Your passport should be valid for the whole of your stay in the UK.

    You may also be asked to prove that:

    - you’re visiting for tourism
    - you’re able to support yourself and your dependents during your trip (or have funding from someone else to support you)
    - you’ve arranged accommodation for your stay
    - you’re able to pay for your return or onward journey (or have funding from someone else)
    - you’ll leave the UK at the end of your visit

    ^The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

    ## If you’re under 18 and travelling alone with an ETA

    You may need to show a letter from your parent or guardian giving:

    - their contact details and consent for you to travel to the UK
    - the name, date of birth, address and relationship to you of the person you’re staying with
    - their consent for you to stay with the person named in the letter

    ###If you’re not staying with a close relative

    Your parent or guardian must tell the relevant local authority about your visit if you’re both of the following:

    - under 16 (or under 18 if you have a disability)
    - going to be looked after for more than 28 days by someone who is not a close relative (called ‘private foster care’)

    You should bring a reply from the local authority if you have one.
