    ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025

    You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta) to come to the UK if you already have one.

    All of the following must apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 14 October 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025
    * you're only going to do activities that are permitted with an ETA

    You can use an ETA for some business and academic activities, but you must get a visa if you plan to work in the UK.

    You can use [an ETA](/eta) to come to the UK if you’re either:

    - invited as an expert in your profession doing a ‘[permitted paid engagement](/standard-visitor/paid-engagement-event)’
    - visiting for certain business or academic activities, but not working in the UK

    You must meet the eligibility requirements and only be doing permitted activities.

    ## If you’re invited as an expert in your profession and you have an ETA

    You can use [an ETA](/eta) to stay in the UK for up to 6 months. You can only be paid by a UK-based organisation to do certain things, for example:

    - give guest lectures at a higher education institution
    - provide advocacy in legal proceedings
    - take part in arts, entertainment or sporting activities

    If you’re doing a permitted paid engagement, you must do it within one month of arriving. You can stay in the UK for up to 6 months, but cannot do any paid engagements after the first month.
