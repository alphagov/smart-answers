    ###If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025

    You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta) to come to the UK if you already have one.

    All of the following must apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 14 October 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 25 November 2025
    * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

    An ETA lets you stay in the UK for up to 6 months.

    You’ll usually need a visa or a family permit to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:
