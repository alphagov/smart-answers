  You must usually apply for a [family visa](/uk-family-visa).

  ##When you can apply for a free permit instead

  You may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit/) instead of a visa. Your close family member must both:

  + be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein
  + have been living in the UK by 31 December 2020

  The family permit lets you live, work and study in the UK for up to 6 months (this may be 4 months if you come to the UK after 1 April 2021). You may then be able to apply to the free EU Settlement Scheme to stay longer in the UK.
