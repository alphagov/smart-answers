  - you arrive and depart by air

  You must also have an Irish biometric visa (marked ‘BC’ or ‘BC BIVS’ in the ‘Remarks’ section) and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland.

  E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.

  All visas and residence permits must be valid.

  You will not be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you do not qualify under the immigration rules.
