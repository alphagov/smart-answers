  What you need to apply for depends on your circumstances.

  You need an ETA for some business and academic activities, but you must get a visa if you plan to work in the UK.

  You will need to [apply for an ETA](/eta) to come to the UK if you're either:

  - invited as an expert in your profession doing a '[permitted paid engagement](/standard-visitor/paid-engagement-event)'
  - visiting for certain business or academic activities, but not working in the UK

  You must meet the eligibility requirements and only be doing permitted activities.

  ##If you’re invited as an expert in your profession
