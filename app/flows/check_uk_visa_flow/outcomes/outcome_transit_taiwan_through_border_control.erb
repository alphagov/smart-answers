  You’ll need to [apply for an electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta) instead.

  You should also bring the [same documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) you’d need to apply for a visa to show to officers at the UK border.

  ^If the bio data page in your passport does not include a personal ID number, you should apply for a [Visitor in Transit](/transit-visa) visa.

  ## Transiting without a visa

  If your passport does not have a personal ID number, you might be eligible to transit without a visa if:

  - you arrive and depart by air

  - have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours

  - have the correct documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

  One of the following must also apply:

  - you’re travelling to (or on part of a reasonable journey to) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country
  - you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country
  - you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa
  - you have a permanent residence permit issued by Australia or New Zealand
  - you have a common format residence permit issued by an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland
  - you have a permanent residence permit issued by Canada on or after 28 June 2002
  - you have a uniform format category D visa for entry to a country in the EEA or Switzerland
  - you have an Irish biometric visa (marked ‘BC’ or ‘BC BIVS’ in the ‘Remarks’ section) and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland
  - you’re travelling from the Republic of Ireland and it’s less than 3 months since you were last given permission, on the basis of holding a valid Irish biometric visa, to land or be in Ireland
  - you have a valid USA permanent residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998
  - you have a valid USA I-551 Temporary Immigrant visa issued by the USA (a wet-ink stamp version will not be accepted)
  - you have an expired USA I-551 Permanent Residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998, with a valid I-797 letter authorising extension
  - you have a valid standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B issued by the USA (attached to a sealed brown envelope)

  You will not be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you do not qualify under the immigration rules. You can [apply for a transit visa](/transit-visa) before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa.

  E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.

  All visas and residence permits must be valid.

  Australian paper confirmation slips are not accepted.

  ^ Transiting without a visa is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You will not be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.
