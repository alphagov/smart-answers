  Whether you need a visa depends on how long you’re staying in the UK.

  ##If you’re staying 6 months or less

  You may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) to join your partner or family member for up to 6 months (this may be 4 months if you come to the UK after 1 April 2021).

  ##If you’re staying longer than 6 months

  What you can apply for depends on your family member’s situation.

  ###Your partner or family member was living in the UK by 31 December 2020

  You may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) instead of applying for a visa.

  The family permit lets you live, work and study in the UK for up to 6 months (this may be 4 months if you come to the UK after 1 April 2021). You may then  be able to apply to the free EU Settlement Scheme to stay longer in the UK.

  ###Your partner or family member are working or studying in the UK

  You may be able to apply as a ‘dependant’ of your partner or family member’s visa. You can work or study if your application is successful.

  [Browse for your family member’s type of visa](/browse/visas-immigration) to find out how to apply.
