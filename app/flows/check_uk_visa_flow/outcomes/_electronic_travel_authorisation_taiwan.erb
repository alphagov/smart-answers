What you need to apply for depends on:

+ whether or not your passport has a personal ID number on the bio data page
+ what you're coming to the UK to do

## If your passport does not have a personal ID number on the bio data page

You will need a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) if you’re coming to the UK for certain business or academic activities, such as:

+ going to meetings or conferences
+ doing academic research
+ doing certain paid engagements or events (a ‘permitted paid engagement’) for UK-based organisations

For all other activities, you’ll need a [work visa](/browse/visas-immigration/work-visas).

You will not need an ETA.
