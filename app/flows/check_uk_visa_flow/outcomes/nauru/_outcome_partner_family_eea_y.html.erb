  ###If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 20 January 2026


  You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta) to come to the UK if you already have one.

  All of the following must apply:

  * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 9 December 2025
  * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 20 January 2026
  * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

  An ETA lets you stay in the UK for up to 6 months.

  If you leave the UK and need to re-enter, you may not be able to use your ETA to return.
