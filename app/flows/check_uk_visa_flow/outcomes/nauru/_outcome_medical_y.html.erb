  ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 20 January 2026

  What you'll need to come to the UK may be different if both the following apply:

  * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 9 December 2025
  * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 20 January 2026

  You can come to the UK with either of the following:

  * a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor)
  * an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta), if you already have one 

  You must meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements even if you have an ETA.

  ^The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

  ###If your treatment will last longer than 6 months

  You must apply for a Standard Visitor visa for medical treatment lasting longer than 6 months.

  You can either: 

  - [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa) before you come to the UK - this lasts for up to 11 months and costs £220
  - visit for up to 6 months and [apply to stay for a further 6 months when you’re in the UK](/standard-visitor/extend-your-stay) for a fee of £1,100

  There is no limit on how many times you can extend your stay. It costs £1,100 each time you do.

  Depending on where you come from, you may also need a certificate that proves you do not have tuberculosis (TB). [Check if you’ll need to take a TB test](/tb-test-visa).

  ###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK 

  You’ll usually need a Standard Visitor visa to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:  

  * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 9 December 2025
  * you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 20 January 2026
