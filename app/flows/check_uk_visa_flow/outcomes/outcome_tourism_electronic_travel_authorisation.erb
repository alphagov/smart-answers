  - claim [public funds](/government/publications/public-funds--2) (benefits)
  - live in the UK for long periods of time through frequent or successive visits
  - marry or register a civil partnership, or give notice of marriage or civil partnership. You’ll need a [Marriage Visitor visa](/marriage-visa) instead

  - you’re able to support yourself and your dependents during your trip (or have funding from someone else to support you)
  - you’ve arranged accommodation for your stay
  - you’re able to pay for your return or onward journey (or have funding from someone else)

  You may need to show a letter from your parent or guardian giving:

  - their contact details and consent for you to travel to the UK
  - the name, date of birth, address and relationship to you of the person you’re staying with
  - their consent for you to stay with the person named in the letter

  If you’re not staying with a close relative

  Your parent or guardian must tell the relevant local authority about your visit if you’re both of the following:

  - under 16 (or under 18 if you have a disability)
  - going to be looked after for more than 28 days by someone who is not a close relative (called ‘private foster care’)

  ^You should bring a reply from the local authority if you have one.
