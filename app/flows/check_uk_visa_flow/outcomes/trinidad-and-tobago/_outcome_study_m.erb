    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    ^The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

    ## What you can and cannot do with an ETA

    You can visit the UK to study at an [accredited institution](/visa-to-study-english/your-course) for up to 6 months, this includes English language courses.

    You can also do:

    - a short piece of research that’s relevant to your course overseas, if you have been accepted by a UK higher education institution
    - an ‘elective’ (an optional additional placement) at a UK higher education institution, if you’re studying medicine, nursing, midwifery, dentistry or veterinary medicine and science
    - an unpaid clinical attachment or dental observer post, if you’re an overseas graduate from a medical, dental or nursing school
    - a recreational course of up to 30 days, for example a dance course

    You can do [other permitted activities as a Standard Visitor](/standard-visitor).

    You cannot:

    - study at a [state funded school or academy](/types-of-school)
    - do a course that lasts longer than 6 months (except if you’re doing a distance learning course)
    - do paid or unpaid work (this includes work experience or work placements, unless it is an eligible medical, nursing, midwifery, dentistry or veterinary medicine and science placement)
    - live in the UK for long periods of time through frequent or successive visits get [public funds](/government/publications/public-funds--2) (benefits)

    To study or research certain subjects at postgraduate level or above, you may need an [Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate](/guidance/find-out-if-you-require-an-atas-certificate). If you do need one, you’ll need to get your ATAS certificate before starting your study or research.

    ## What you need at the UK border if you have an ETA

    You need a valid passport or travel document. Your passport should be valid for the whole of your stay in the UK.

    You must provide written confirmation from a higher education provider if you’re visiting to do research or an elective.

    If you’re visiting to do an unpaid clinical attachment or dental observer post you must:

    - provide written confirmation of your offer
    - confirm you’ve not done a clinical attachment or dental observer post in the UK before

    You may also be asked to prove that:

    - you’ve been accepted on to a course by an accredited institution, for example a letter of acceptance on official headed paper stating the course name, duration and cost
    - you’re able to support yourself and your dependents during your trip (or have funding from someone else to support you)
    - you’re able to pay for your return or onward journey (or have funding from someone else)
    - you’ve arranged accommodation for your stay
    - you’ll leave the UK at the end of your visit

    - their contact details and consent for you to travel to the UK
    - the name, date of birth, address and relationship to you of the person you’re staying with
    - their consent for you to stay with the person named in the letter

    - under 16 (or under 18 if you have a disability)
    - going to be looked after for more than 28 days by someone who is not a close relative (called ‘private foster care’)

    You should bring a reply from the local authority if you have one.
