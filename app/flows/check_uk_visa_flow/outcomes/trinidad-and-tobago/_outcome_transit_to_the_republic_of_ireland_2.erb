    ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta) to pass through UK border control, if you already have one.

    All of the following must apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025
    * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

    ^You do not need an ETA if you will not pass through UK border control. You should bring evidence of your onward journey, such as a ticket to your destination.

    You always pass through border control if you:

    - leave the main airport building for any reason
    - need to collect your bags and check them in to your onward flight

    You must also pass through border control if both:

    - your onward flight leaves on a different calendar day to when you arrive
    - there’s nowhere for you to stay overnight in the airport, for example in a transit hotel

    Check with your airline if you’re not sure if you’ll pass through UK border control.
