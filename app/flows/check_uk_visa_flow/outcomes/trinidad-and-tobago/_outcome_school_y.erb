    ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta) to stay in the UK if you already have one.

    All of the following must apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025
    * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

    An ETA lets you stay in the UK for up to 6 months.

    ###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK 

    You cannot use your ETA to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:  

    * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    You’ll need to get a Standard Visitor visa or Parent of a Child Student visa instead.
