    ## If you want to convert a civil partnership into a marriage

    You do not need a Marriage Visitor visa to [convert your civil partnership into a marriage](/convert-civil-partnership).

    You’ll usually need to apply for a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa). 

    ###If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    You may be able to use an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta) to come to the UK if you already have one.


    All of the following must apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025
    * you meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements

    An ETA lets you stay in the UK for up to 6 months.

    If you leave the UK and need to re-enter, you may not be able to use your ETA to return.

    You’ll usually need a Standard Visitor visa to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply: 

    * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025
