    ##If you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    What you'll need to come to the UK may be different if both the following apply:

    * you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025

    You can come to the UK with either of the following:

    * a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor)
    * an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/eta), if you already have one 

    You must meet the [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) eligibility requirements even if you have an ETA.

    ^The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

    ###If your treatment will last longer than 6 months

    You must apply for a Standard Visitor visa for medical treatment lasting longer than 6 months.

    You can either: 

    - [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa) before you come to the UK - this lasts for up to 11 months and costs £200
    - visit for up to 6 months and [apply to stay for a further 6 months when you’re in the UK](/standard-visitor/extend-your-stay) for a fee of £1,000

    There is no limit on how many times you can extend your stay. It costs £1,000 each time you do.

    Depending on where you come from, you may also need a certificate that proves you do not have tuberculosis (TB). [Check if you’ll need to take a TB test](/tb-test-visa).

    ###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK 

    You’ll usually need a Standard Visitor visa to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:  

    * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 12 March 2025
    * you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 23 April 2025
