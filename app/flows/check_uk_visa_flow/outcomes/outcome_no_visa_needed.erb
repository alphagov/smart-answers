    You do not need an ETA if you will not pass through UK border control. You should bring evidence of your onward journey, such as a ticket to your destination.

    You always pass through border control if you:

    + leave the main airport building for any reason
    + need to collect your bags and check them in to your onward flight

    You must also pass through border control if both:

    + your onward flight leaves on a different calendar day to when you arrive
    + there's nowhere for you to stay overnight in the airport, for example in a transit hotel

    Check with your airline if you're not sure if you'll pass through UK border control.

    %You may want to apply for a [transit visa](/transit-visa) instead if you have a criminal record or you’ve previously been refused entry into the UK.
