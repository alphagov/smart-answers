  You must apply for either:

  - an [electronic travel authorisation (ETA)](/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta)
  - a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor)

  ^The rules on what you’ll need to enter the UK may be different if you’re [travelling from Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man](/guidance/travelling-between-the-uk-and-ireland-isle-of-man-guernsey-or-jersey).

  ##If your treatment will last longer than 6 months

  You must apply for a Standard Visitor visa for medical treatment lasting longer than 6 months.

  You can:

  - [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa) before you come to the UK - this lasts for up to 11 months and costs £190
  - visit for up to 6 months and [apply to stay for a further 6 months when you’re in the UK](/standard-visitor/extend-your-stay) for a fee of £993

  There is no limit on how many times you can extend your stay. It costs £993 each time you do.

  Depending on where you come from, you may also need a certificate that proves you do not have tuberculosis (TB). [Check if you’ll need to take a TB test](/tb-test-visa).
