  %You may want to [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa) if you have a criminal record or you’ve previously been refused entry into the UK.%

  ##What you can and cannot do

  You can visit the UK to study at an [accredited institution](/visa-to-study-english/your-course) for up to 6 months, this includes English language courses.

  * a short piece of research that’s relevant to your course overseas
  * an ‘elective’ - an optional additional placement, if you’re studying medicine, nursing, dentistry or veterinary medicine and science 
  * an unpaid clinical attachment or dental observer post, if you’re an overseas graduate from a medical, dental or nursing school
  * a recreational course of up to 30 days, for example a dance course

  * provide written confirmation of your offer 
  * confirm you’ve not done a clinical attachment or dental observer post in the UK before
