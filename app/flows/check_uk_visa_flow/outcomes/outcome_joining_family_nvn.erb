  If the family member you’re joining is from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit). This makes it easier and quicker to enter the UK. Your family member must have been living in the UK by 31 December 2020.

  ##If you’re staying longer than 6 months
  The visa you apply for depends on your family member’s situation. You can work or study if your application is successful.

    ^You may also be able to apply for a [British National Overseas (BNO) visa](/british-national-overseas-bno-visa). If you have other family members who also want a BNO visa, they must meet the eligibility requirements.

  ###Your family is settled in the UK
  You may be able to apply for a [family visa](/uk-family-visa) if your family member or partner:

  + is a British citizen
  + is settled in the UK (called having ‘indefinite leave to remain’)
  + has settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme
  + has a Turkish worker or businessperson visa

  Your family member must be your partner, child, parent, or a relative who’ll provide long-term care for you.

  ###Your family is working or studying in the UK
  You may be able to apply as a ‘dependant’ of your partner or parent’s visa if they’re working or studying in the UK.

  [Browse for your family member’s type of visa](/browse/visas-immigration) to find out how to apply.

  ###Your family member was living in the UK by 31 December 2020

  You may be able to apply to the free [EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) instead of applying for a visa. Your close family member must:

  + be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein
  + have been living in the UK by 31 December 2020
  + have settled or pre-settled status

  To be eligible to apply from outside the UK, you must either:

  + be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein and have a biometric passport or national identity card
  + have a biometric residence card (BRC) or biometric residence permit (BRP) issued in the UK which has not expired

  Otherwise you'll need to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) to come to the UK. Once you're in the UK you can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.
