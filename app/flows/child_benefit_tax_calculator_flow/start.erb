  Estimate the Child Benefit you've received and your High Income Child Benefit tax charge
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
Use this tool to get an estimate of:

- how much money you get from Child Benefit in a tax year
- the High Income Child Benefit tax charge you or your partner may have to pay
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :post_body do %>
You may be affected by the tax charge if your ‘adjusted net income’ is:

- over £60,000 for the tax year 2024 to 2025 and 2025 to 2026
- over £50,000 for tax years 2012 to 2013 up to tax year 2023 to 2024

Adjusted net income includes taxable benefits you get from your job, like a company car or medical insurance.

Your partner is responsible for paying the tax charge if their adjusted net income is also more than:

- £60,000 and higher than yours for the tax year 2024 to 2025 and 2025 to 2026
- £50,000 and higher than yours for tax years 2012 to 2013 up to tax year 2023 to 2024


You’ll need the dates your Child Benefit claim started and, if applicable, when you stopped:

- being [eligible for Child Benefit](/child-benefit/eligibility) 
- getting payments because you [opted out of Child Benefit payments](/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit)
