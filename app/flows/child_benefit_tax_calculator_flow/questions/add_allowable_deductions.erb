  Examples of allowable deductions include:

  - pension contributions deducted from your pay after tax (check with your employer if you’re not sure if they make deductions)
  - pension contributions not paid from your salary (the amount you actually paid, not the grossed-up amount)
  - Gift Aid donations - use the amount you paid, not the amount the charity can claim
