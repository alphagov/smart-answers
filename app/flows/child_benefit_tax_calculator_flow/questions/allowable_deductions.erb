  Examples of allowable deductions include:

  - pension contributions deducted from your pay after tax (check with your employer if you’re not sure if they make deductions)
  - pension contributions not paid from your salary (the amount you actually paid, not the grossed-up amount)
  - Gift Aid donations - use the amount you paid, not the amount the charity can claim

  Do not include deductions from cycle scheme or retirement annuity contracts.

  If you are not sure whether something is an allowable deduction, [contact the Income Tax Helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees).
