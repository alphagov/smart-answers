  Add up your [taxable income](/income-tax). This includes things like:

  - your salary before tax (with pension contributions under net pay arrangements deducted)
  - other employment income, for example bonuses
  - income from pensions before tax, for example from a state pension
  - other income before tax, for example taxable profits from self-employment, taxable savings and dividends
  - income from property before tax, for example taxable rental income

  You can get some of this information from your P60, P11D, employer or tax adviser.

  This list is not exhaustive. If you are not sure whether a source of income is taxable, [contact the Income Tax Helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees).

  Do not combine your household income. Use your partner’s taxable income if it’s higher than yours.
