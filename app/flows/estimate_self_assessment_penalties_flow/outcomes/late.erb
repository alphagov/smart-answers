  These figures are estimates based on the figures you gave. The total is rounded down to the nearest pound.

  ##If you have not sent your tax return or paid your tax bill
  [Send your Self Assessment tax return](/self-assessment-tax-returns/sending-return) to HMRC and [pay your Self Assessment tax bill](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill). The sooner you do this, the lower your penalty will be.

  If you cannot pay all the tax now, you might be able to [set up a payment plan](/difficulties-paying-hmrc/pay-in-instalments).

  ##Paying any penalties
  HMRC will send you a penalty notice by letter or email. The notice will tell you:

* how much the penalty is
* how to pay the penalty

  ^You do not have to pay any penalties unless you’re asked to by HMRC. The amount that HMRC asks for might be different than this estimate.^

  ##If you disagree with a penalty
  You can [appeal a penalty](/tax-appeals/penalty) if you have a [reasonable excuse](/tax-appeals/reasonable-excuses) or you think the penalty is wrong.

  You usually have 30 days from the date on your penalty notice to contact HMRC or appeal.
