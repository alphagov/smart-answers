  This calculator is for students living in England starting a new undergraduate funded course in academic years:

  - 2025 to 2026
  - 2026 to 2027

  ^Student finance is changing. If your course starts on or after 1 January 2027, [find out what you could get](/student-finance-from-1-january-2027).

  There’s a different way to check how much you can get if you’re [a student from Scotland](https://www.saas.gov.uk/), [a student from Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/) or [a student from Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/).

  Use this calculator to estimate the amount you could get in:

  - Tuition Fee Loans to help pay your course tuition fees
  - Maintenance Loans to help with your living costs
  - extra funding, for example if you’re on a low income, are disabled, have children or are studying a certain course
  
  ## Before you start

  To use the calculator, you need to know what [type of funding you’re eligible for](/student-finance/who-qualifies), either:

  - Tuition Fee Loans and Maintenance Loans (also known as ‘full support’)
  - Tuition Fee Loans only (also known as ‘tuition fee only funding’)
  
  If you're eligible for a Maintenance Loan, you'll need to know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

  If you’re a part-time student, you'll also need to know how many credits you’ll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.
