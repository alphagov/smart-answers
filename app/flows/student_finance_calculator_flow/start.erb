  This calculator is for students living in England starting a new undergraduate course in academic years:

  - 2024 to 2025
  - 2025 to 2026

  ^ There is a different way to check how much you can get if you’re [a student from Scotland](https://www.saas.gov.uk/), [a student from Wales](https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/) or [a student from Northern Ireland](https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/).
  
  Use this calculator to estimate:
  
  - the amount you could get in student loans
  - extra funding, for example if you’re disabled or have children
  
  ## Before you start

  To use the calculator, you need to know what [type of funding you’re eligible for](/student-finance/who-qualifies) (Tuition Fee Loan and Maintenance Loan or Tuition Fee Loan only).

  If you're eligible for a Maintenance Loan, you'll need to know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

  If you’re a part-time student, you'll also need to know how many credits you’ll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.
