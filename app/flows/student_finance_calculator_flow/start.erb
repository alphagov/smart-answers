  This calculator is for students from England or the European Union (EU) starting a new undergraduate course in academic years:

  + 2022 to 2023
  + 2023 to 2024

  Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

  + student loans
  + extra student funding, for example if you’re disabled or have children

  Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

  If you’re a part-time student you’ll need to know how many credits you’ll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.

  You cannot use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk) or [Northern Ireland.](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk)
