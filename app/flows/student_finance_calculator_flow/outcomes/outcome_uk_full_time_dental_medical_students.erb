    Read the [guidance on student finance and how to apply](/student-finance/new-fulltime-students).

    ^You may get a smaller amount of funding to start with while Student Finance England (SFE) reviews your application. They'll send you a top-up payment later if you're eligible for it – [check your online account for updates](/student-finance-register-login).


  ##If you’re studying to become a doctor or dentist

    The amount you get will change during your course.

    In each of your first 4 years, you could get:

    <%= render partial: 'tuition_maintenance_summary', locals: { tuition_fee_amount: calculator.tuition_fee_amount, maintenance_loan_amount: calculator.maintenance_loan_amount, maintenance_grant_amount: calculator.maintenance_grant_amount, start_date: calculator.course_start, max_loan_amount: calculator.max_loan_amount, loan_shortfall: calculator.loan_shortfall, tuition_fee_url: "/student-finance/new-fulltime-students", maintenance_loan_url: "/student-finance/new-fulltime-students", uk_ft_circumstances: calculator.uk_ft_circumstances, uk_all_circumstances: calculator.uk_all_circumstances } %>

    In your fifth and sixth years, you could get <%= format_money(calculator.reduced_maintenance_loan_for_healthcare, pounds_only: true) %> reduced Maintenance Loan.
    You can also apply for [NHS funding](/nhs-bursaries) and get the following depending on your circumstances:

    
    <% if calculator.eligible_for_childcare_grant_one_child? %>
      - up to 85% of your childcare costs (maximum <%= format_money(calculator.childcare_grant_one_child) %> a week for a single child or <%= format_money(calculator.childcare_grant_more_than_one_child) %> a week if you have more than one) in Childcare Grant
    <% elsif calculator.eligible_for_childcare_grant_more_than_one_child? %>
      - up to 85% of your childcare costs to a maximum <%= format_money(calculator.childcare_grant_more_than_one_child) %> a week in Childcare Grant if you have 2 or more children
    <% end %>

    <% if calculator.eligible_for_parent_learning_allowance? %>
      - up to <%= format_money(calculator.parent_learning_allowance) %> per year [Parents’ Learning Allowance](/parents-learning-allowance)
    <% end %>

    <% if calculator.eligible_for_adult_dependant_allowance? %>
      - up to <%= format_money(calculator.adult_dependant_allowance) %> per year [Adult Dependant’s Grant](/adult-dependants-grant)
    <% end %>

    <%= render partial: 'nhs_full_time_funding', locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

    If you need more money to fund your living costs and you qualify, you can apply for extra help.

    ^ If you're on a 4 year accelerated graduate course, you'll have to apply for an NHS bursary from your second year.
