  [Read the guidance](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-student-finance) about how to apply.

  ##Tuition costs

  You could get a [Tuition Fee Loan](/student-finance/eu-students) - <%= format_money(calculator.tuition_fee_amount, pounds_only: true) %> per year.

  The loan pays for the cost of your course and must be paid back.

  ##Extra help

  You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college. Usually, this doesn't have to be paid back.

  Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.
