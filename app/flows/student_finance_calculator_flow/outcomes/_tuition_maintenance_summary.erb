    If you’re a care leaver, your household income is not used to calculate your Maintenance Loan. Student Loans Company (SLC) will still use your household income to check what other funding you can get.

    You could get a <%= format_money(maintenance_loan_amount, pounds_only: true) %> [Maintenance Loan](<%= maintenance_loan_url %>) to help with your living costs.

    How your Maintenance Loan is calculated:

    <%= format_money(max_loan_amount, pounds_only: true) %> (the maximum Maintenance Loan available)  
    \- <%= format_money(loan_shortfall, pounds_only: true) %> (the amount you might not be eligible for, based on your answers)  
    = <%= format_money(maintenance_loan_amount, pounds_only: true) %> (the amount you could be eligible for, based on your answers)

    You can find out more about [how Maintenance Loans are calculated](/government/publications/student-finance-how-youre-assessed-and-paid).

    You may get less Maintenance Loan in your final year.
