You must register the death according to the regulations in the country where the person died. You’ll be given a local death certificate.

This death certificate will be accepted in the UK. If it’s not in English, you need to have it translated by an [approved translator](https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/translators-interpreters).

##Register a death abroad with the UK authorities

You can also choose to register a death abroad with the UK authorities, if the death happened on or after 1 January 1983.

You do not have to do this, but if you do:

- the death will be recorded with the General Register Offices or the National Records Office of Scotland

- the death record will be held in the UK

- you can order a consular death registration certificate - this is an optional document that says you’ve registered a death abroad with the UK authorities

^You do not need to register the death with the UK authorities in order to use the [Tell Us Once](https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/death-abroad) service.
