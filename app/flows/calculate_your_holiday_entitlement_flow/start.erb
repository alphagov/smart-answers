  Holiday calculator to work out statutory holiday leave in days or hours
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  Use this tool to calculate holiday entitlement for:

  - a full leave year
  - part of a leave year, if the job started or finished part way through the year

  If an employee works irregular hours or for part of the year, you also use this calculator to work out how much leave they’ve built up (‘accrued’) over a pay period.
