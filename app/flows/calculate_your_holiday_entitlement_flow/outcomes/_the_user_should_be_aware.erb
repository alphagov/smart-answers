Leave entitlement accrues differently in a worker’s first year. This tool calculates leave for a worker who:

* starts part way through the month, by applying one-twelfth of their leave from their first day - an employer can instead choose to calculate the first month’s leave 'pro-rata' (in proportion to the number of days worked)
* leaves employment within the first 12 months, using the “For someone starting and leaving part way through a leave year” option
