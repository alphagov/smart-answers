The user should be aware:

* leave entitlement accrues differently in a worker's first year
* when a worker starts part way through the month, they usually accrue one-twelfth of their leave from their first day
* when a worker leaves employment within the first 12 months, their leave is calculated using the "For someone starting and leaving part way through a leave year" option in the calculator
