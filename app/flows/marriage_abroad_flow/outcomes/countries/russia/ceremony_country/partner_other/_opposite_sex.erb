Contact the relevant local authorities in Russia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, you’ll first need to give notice of your intended marriage. 

For most of Russia, you should give notice at the British Embassy in Moscow.

If you live in the Urals region, give notice at the [British Consulate in Ekaterinburg](/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-ekaterinburg) instead.

You must have lived for at least 3 full working days in the region covered by the embassy or the consulate where you’re giving notice. For example, if you arrive on Tuesday, the earliest you can give notice is the following Monday.

Your partner will need to apply for a CNI from their country’s embassy or consulate. 

You can give notice in person or by post.

###Apply for a CNI in person

You must [book an appointment at the British Embassy Moscow](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=132&service=10) or the [British Consulate Ekaterinburg](/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-ekaterinburg) to give notice of your marriage.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of your address in Russia
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll need to complete: 

- a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form 
- an [‘Affidavit or affirmation of marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll). The Russian spelling of your name needs to be the same on all your Russian language documents - if not, the authorities may not accept your documents.%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You may need to [get the evidence legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [get the evidence translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English or Russian.^

The embassy or consulate will [charge a fee](/government/publications/russia-consular-fees) for receiving the notice.

Your notice of marriage will be displayed publicly for 7 days at the embassy or consulate.

They’ll then issue your CNI on the eighth day (as long as nobody has registered an objection). [There's a fee for this](/government/publications/russia-consular-fees).

###Apply for a CNI by post

You’ll need to download, fill in (but not sign) a [bilingual ‘Notice of marriage’ form and an ‘Affirmation for marriage’](/government/publications/getting-married-in-russia-bilingual-forms) form.

You’ll need to get a local notary public in Russia to witness your signature on these before you send them to the embassy or consulate. The notary public will charge a fee.

You’ll also need to send certified copies of your passport and proof of your address in Russia. You also need to send equivalent documents for your partner.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll). The Russian spelling of your name needs to be the same on all your Russian language documents - if not, the authorities may not accept your documents.%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You may need to [get the evidence legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [get the evidence translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English or Russian.^

Post the forms and any supporting documents to the [British Embassy in Moscow](/world/organisations/british-embassy-moscow) or the [British Consulate in Ekaterinburg](/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-ekaterinburg), if you live in the Urals region. Contact the consulate or embassy for advice before you post your application.

They’ll then issue your CNI. [There's a fee for this](/government/publications/russia-consular-fees). 

You will need to get a courier to return your documents to you.

###What happens next

^You do not need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

After you get your CNI, make an appointment to register your marriage with the local marriage registrar.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
