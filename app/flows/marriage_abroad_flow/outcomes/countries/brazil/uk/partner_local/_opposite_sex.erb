Contact the [Embassy of Brazil](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Brazil](/foreign-travel-advice/brazil) before making any plans.

You might be able to form an opposite sex civil partnership. Check the local rules with the Embassy of Brazil.

## What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local:

* [register office in England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices)
* [register office in Scotland (PDF, 64KB)](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf)
* [register office in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland)
* [register office in the Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages)
* [register office in Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71)
* [register office in Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

For your CNI to be valid in Brazil, you'll need to: 

- [get your CNI 'legalised'](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) in the UK
- [get your CNI translated by a sworn translator in Brazil](/government/publications/brazil-list-of-lawyers)

You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%
