# Parents and partners - forms

Some student finance (eg a Maintenance Grant) is based on income.

You must send your income details for the 2013 to 2014 tax year. Do this using form PFF2.

If you think your income has dropped by 15% or more since the 2013 to 2014 tax year you’ll need to do both of the following:

+ submit your 2013 to 2014 income details using form PFF2
+ complete a CYI form (to ask for the student finance to be based on your expected 2015 to 2016 tax year income)
