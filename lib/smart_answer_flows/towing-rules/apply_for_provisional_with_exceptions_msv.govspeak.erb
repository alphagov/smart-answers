  If you apply for a provisional C1 medium-sized vehicle licence then pass the C1 test you can tow trailers up to 750 kg, as long as the combined vehicle and trailer weight isn’t more than 7,500 kg.

  If you want to tow heavier trailers you’ll need the C1+E entitlement. You normally have to wait until you’re 21 to get this.

  ##Getting the C1+E entitlement at 18

  There are some cases when you can get the C1+E entitlement at 18. See the [guide to Driver CPC](/driver-certificate-of-professional-competence-cpc) for more information.
