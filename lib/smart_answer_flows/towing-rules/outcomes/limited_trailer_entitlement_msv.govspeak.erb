  You can tow trailers up to 750kg with a standard C1 medium-sized vehicle licence as long as the towing vehicle weight is not more than 7,500kg.

  If you want to tow heavier trailers you’ll need to apply for provisional C1+E entitlement then pass the C1+E test.

  This will let you tow vehicle and trailer combinations up to 12,000kg. The fully loaded trailer cannot weigh more than the unladen vehicle.
