  You don’t need to make right to rent check if the person is staying in a hostel or refuge:

  - that is managed by a social landlord, voluntary organisation or charity
  - that isn’t operated as a commercial basis
  - that is partly or wholly funded by a government department, agency or local authority

  You’ll have to carry out a check in all other cases.
