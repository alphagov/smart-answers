  You need to check if a tenant is allowed to rent private residential property in England
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  Find out if someone can rent your private residential property in England.

  You must check anyone aged 18 or over who pays to use your property as their main home, for example, tenants, sub-tenants and paying house guests.

  %You might  [get a fine](/penalties-illegal-renting) if you rent your property to someone who doesn’t have the right to rent.%

  If you’ve bought a property that already has tenants, you need proof that their last landlord did the check. You’ll still be responsible for carrying out [further checks](/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/further-checks) on your tenants in future.

  Because of coronavirus (COVID‑19) there are [temporary changes to the way you can check documents](/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-landlord-right-to-rent-checks). These changes include asking for documents digitally, making checks on a video call, and what to do if someone cannot provide any accepted documents.

  ^Read more about the [right to rent documents](/government/publications/right-to-rent-document-checks-a-user-guide) you can accept.^

  Use a different service to [check a tenant’s right to rent if they’ve given you their share code](/view-right-to-rent). You will not need to check their documents.
