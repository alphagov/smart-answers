  This calculator is for students from England or the European Union (EU) starting a new undergraduate course in academic years:

  + 2018 to 2019
  + 2019 to 2020

  Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

  + student loans
  + extra student funding, for example if you’re disabled or have children

  Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

  If you're a part-time student applying for the 2018 to 2019 academic year, you'll need to know how many credits you'll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.

  Ask your university or college if you're not sure.

  You can’t use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk) or [Northern Ireland.](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk)
