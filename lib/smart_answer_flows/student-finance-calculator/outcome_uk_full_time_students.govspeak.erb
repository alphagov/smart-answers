    ^Your result is an estimate. Usually, you only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher education qualification - check if you [qualify](/student-finance/who-qualifies).^

    ##Extra help

    You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college.

    You might be able to get [help with the costs of travel for study or work placements](/travel-grants-medical-dental-students-england) as part of your course.

    Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

    ^Student loans have to be paid back - bursaries, allowances and grants don’t.^
