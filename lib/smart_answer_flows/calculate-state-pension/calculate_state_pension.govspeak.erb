  State Pension calculator
<% end %>

<% content_for :meta_description do %>
  Work out your State Pension age and Pension Credit qualifying age or estimate how much basic State Pension you may get
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  Use the calculator to:

	*	work out when you’ll reach State Pension age
	*	work out your Pension Credit qualifying age
	*	find out when you’ll be eligible for free bus travel
	
##If you’re under 55

The calculator also gives an estimate of your basic State Pension under the current rules - not the [new State Pension](/new-state-pension) rules.  

It doesn’t estimate any [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension).

##If you’re 55 or over

Don’t use the calculator to work out your State Pension. Get a [State Pension Statement](/state-pension-statement) instead.

  ##What you need

You need to enter the number of years you:

* worked and paid National Insurance
* got unemployment, sickness or disability benefits
* claimed Child Benefit or were a carer or foster carer

Don’t count the current tax year. Count tax years from 6 April to 5 April and don’t count any years twice, eg when you were working and getting benefits. 
              
This calculator uses a simplified calculation based on the current law. It can’t take into account every circumstance that might affect you.  

^Don’t use the calculator to make future financial decisions.^
