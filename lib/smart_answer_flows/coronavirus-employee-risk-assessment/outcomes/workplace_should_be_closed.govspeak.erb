    ### If your employer has no work for you 

    Your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate and put you on temporary leave instead. This is known as being put ‘on furlough’.

    Your employer could get a grant using the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to help them pay for some of your wages. [Check if your employer can use it](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-could-be-covered-by-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme).

    If your salary is reduced because of these changes, [check if you’re eligible for Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility).
