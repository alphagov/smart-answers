    ## You should work from home or get support if you cannot

    You should work from home, and your employer is expected to help and support you.

    If your job cannot be done from home, you should discuss options with your employer.

    ### When rules will change:
    
    From 1 August 2020:

    - you should adopt strict social distancing rather than full shielding measures
    - if you cannot work from home, you can go to work (as long as the business is COVID-safe)
    - you should remain cautious as you are still at risk of severe illness if you catch coronavirus (stay home or practical social distancing as much as possible)
    - the support from the National Shielding Service of free food parcels, medicine deliveries and care will stop
    - you will still be eligible for priority supermarket slots (if you registered by 17 July)
    - you might still be able to get help getting food, prescriptions, and other essential items from a volunteer through the [NHS Volunteer Responders Programme](https://volunteering.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/nhs-volunteer-responders-portal/isolating)
