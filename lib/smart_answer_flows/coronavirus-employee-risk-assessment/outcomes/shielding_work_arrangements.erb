    ## You can go to work as long as the workplace is Covid-secure but should work from home where possible 

    The guidance for the clinically extremely vulnerable is that shielding has been paused. This means you do not need to follow previous shielding advice.

    You can go to work as long as the workplace is [Covid-secure](/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19), but should carry on working from home wherever possible.

    If you cannot work from home, you should be offered the option of the safest available on-site roles, enabling you to maintain social distancing guidelines. It may be appropriate for you to take up an alternative role or adjusted working pattern temporarily.

    You should remain cautious as you are still at risk of severe illness if you catch coronavirus.

    You should adopt strict social distancing rather than full shielding measures. This means:

    - you can go outside as much as you like but you should still try to keep your overall social interactions low
    - you can visit businesses, such as supermarkets, pubs and shops, while keeping 2 metres away from others wherever possible or 1 metre, plus other precautions
    - you should continue to wash your hands carefully and more frequently than usual and that you maintain thorough cleaning of frequently touched areas in your home and/or workspace
    - you will no longer receive free food parcels, medicine deliveries and basic care from the National Shielding Service
