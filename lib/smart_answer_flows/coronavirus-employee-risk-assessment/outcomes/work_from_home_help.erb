    ## Get help to work from home
    Your employer should help you work from home by:

    - discussing home working arrangements
    - making sure you’ve the right equipment, for example, remote access to work systems
    - including you in all necessary communications
    - looking after your physical and mental wellbeing

    This will apply to many different types of businesses, particularly for employees who would have typically worked in offices or on-site.

    If your employer is not taking all practical steps to promote social distancing, you can report this to your local authority, or the [Health and Safety Executive](https://www.hse.gov.uk/) who can take a range of actions, including requiring your employer to take additional steps where appropriate.
    
    If your employer wants you to return to work, you can go back as long as the workplace is [Covid-secure](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19)
