  Calculate how much statutory redundancy you can get. It’s based on age, weekly pay and number of years in the job.

  Your weekly pay is the average you earned per week over the 12 weeks before the day you got your redundancy notice.

 ^If you were paid less than usual because you were ‘on furlough’ because of coronavirus, use what you would have earned normally when calculating your redundancy pay, not what you were paid while on furlough.

  You only qualify for statutory redundancy pay if you’ve worked for your employer for at least 2 years.
