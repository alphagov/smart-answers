  Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the flat rate of £<%= flat_rate_amount %> per week. This is an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service would calculate might be different.

  This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.  

  <% if paying_or_receiving == 'pay' %>
  Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

  Payment type | Weekly flat rate payment | <%= fees_title %> | Application fee  - you only pay this once
  - | -
  [Collect and Pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £<%= flat_rate_amount %> | £<%= collect_fees %> | £<%= total_fees %> | £20.00
  [Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £<%= flat_rate_amount %> | No fees | £<%= flat_rate_amount %> | £20.00
  [Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £<%= flat_rate_amount %> | No fees | £<%= flat_rate_amount %> | No fee
