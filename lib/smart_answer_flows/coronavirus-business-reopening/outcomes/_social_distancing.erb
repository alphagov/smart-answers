## How to ensure social distancing on site

You should always:

- stay 2 metres apart from other employees and customers (or 1 metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not viable)
- wash hands and clean surfaces more regularly
- put up signs and use floor tape to remind people to keep social distance
- keep the number of employees on site to a minimum
- wash your hands and clothes after helping someone in an emergency
- make sure you have enough appropriately trained staff to keep people safe (for example, having dedicated staff to encourage social distancing or to manage security)
- limit access to the kitchen
- limit contact between the kitchen workers and other employees (also when on breaks)
- have screens between equipment in larger kitchens
- have one person at a time getting things from the pantry, fridge and freezer
- minimise contact with other employees when handing over food
- ask employees to change into work uniforms on site (providing changing areas where social distancing is possible)
- wash staff uniforms on site where possible and not let employees take them home
- provide training for workers on new ways of working

Where you cannot stay 2 metres apart (or 1 metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not viable) you should:

- only work together up to 15 minutes at a time
- use screens and barriers to separate people where possible
- work side by side or back-to-back rather than face-to-face
- have fixed teams to minimise exposure

### Entrances and exits

You should:

- stagger arrival and departure times
- open more entrances and exits to the site
- use screens in reception areas
- mark a one-way flow where possible
- provide hand washing facilities or hand sanitiser
- provide more parking
- provide facilities to help people cycle, run or walk to work, for example bike racks
- make sure it's safe to queue and not in the way of traffic (for example, you can route the queues behind permanent physical structures such as street furniture, bike racks or bollards, or put up barriers)

### Moving around the site

You should:

- close off areas that are not essential
- put up signs to use stairs instead of lifts whenever possible, while keeping access to lifts for disabled people
- review layouts and processes to allow employees to work further apart from each other, for example by assigning employees to specific areas of the restaurant or sections of the bar or counter
- ask people to store personal items in lockers if possible
- control the use of corridors, lifts and similar areas, for example with markings on the floor
- have floor markings where people queue, for example toilets
- stagger break times and, if possible, have breaks outdoors
- arrange seating in break areas 2 metres apart (or 1 metre with risk mitigation)
