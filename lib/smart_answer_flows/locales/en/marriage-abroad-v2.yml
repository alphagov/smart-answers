          While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/). The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

        kosovo_uk_resident: |
          Contact the [Embassy of the Republic of Kosovo in London](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          You should also check the [travel advice for %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}](/foreign-travel-advice/%{ceremony_country}).

          You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

          You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf) or [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm).

          ^A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland is valid for 6 months. A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months.^

          ###Legalisation and translation

          You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix} at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.

          You should also check if it needs to be:

          - ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
          - translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046)

          You should also check with the local authorities to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

          ^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

          %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

          ##Fees

          Service | Fee

          You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

          If you need a CNI, you’ll have to give notice of your intended marriage in the country where you live.

          Check with your nearest British embassy or consulate to find out if they can do this for you.

          +[data_partial:overseas_passports_embassies:overseas_passports_embassies]

          You need to have been living in %{ceremony_country_name} for at least 3 days.

          - your passport
          - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
          - proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
          - equivalent documents for your partner

          If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

          - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
          - a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
          - your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

          You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

          The embassy will provide you with forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry. You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

          ##What happens next

          The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

          You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Kosovo.

          You should check with the relevant local authorities in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been resident there for 40 days before the ceremony.

          Some local authorities only issue a certificate of custom law less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

          ^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

          Contact the local town hall (‘mairie’) where you’re getting married to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          If you’re not in France, [your closest French embassy](http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger) may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.

          ^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}.

          You should check with the mairie in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been legally resident there for at least 40 days before the ceremony.

          ^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

          If you need a certificate of custom law, you can get one from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

          Some mairies only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

          ###Applying for a certificate of custom law from the British Embassy

          s1. Download the [certificate of custom law application form](/government/publications/application-for-a-certificate-of-custom-law-for-marriage-france).
          s2. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.
          s3. You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned.
          s4. Send your completed form to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in Euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form. See fee 11 on [consular fees for France](/government/publications/france-consular-fees) for the current cost.
          s5. The embassy will send your certificate and return your documents between 5 and 7 days after receiving your application.


          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The mairie might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it to the mairie instead.

          ##Naturalisation of your foreign partner if they move to the UK

          If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.

          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The tribunal might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not already married or in a civil partnership. It’s not possible to provide this under UK law, so you’ll need to download the explanatory note and take this to the tribunal instead.
