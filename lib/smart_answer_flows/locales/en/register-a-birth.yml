      body: |
        $!You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.$!

        This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document) if it isn’t in English.

        Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.

        You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:

        - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
        - you can order a consular birth registration certificate

        ^You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.^

          You can’t register your child’s birth with the UK authorities abroad. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

          You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) for the child.
