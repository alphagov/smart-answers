        title: |
            Based on your answers, your statutory redundancy payment is £%{statutory_redundancy_pay} (£%{statutory_redundancy_pay_ni} In Northern Ireland).
        body: |
          ##How it’s worked out

          Pay is capped at £%{rate} (£%{ni_rate} In Northern Ireland) per week. Length of service is capped at 20 years.

          ^The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £%{max_amount} (£%{ni_max_amount} In Northern Ireland)^

          Years of service or earnings over these amounts aren’t included in the calculation.

          You can’t get less than the statutory amount but you may get more if your employer has a redundancy scheme. Redundancy pay up to £30,000 is tax-free.

          Your entitlement is %{number_of_weeks_entitlement} weeks.

          You get:

          + 0.5 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re under 22
          + 1 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re between 22 and 41
          + 1.5 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re 41 or older
