      title: Check if someone can rent your residential property
      body: |-
        Find out if someone can rent private residential property in the UK.

        This includes private residential properties for all people aged 18 or over (including house guests, lodgers and sub-tenants) who will use the property as their main home.

        You only have to do this check for new tenancies which started on or after 1 December 2014.

        If you’ve bought a property that is already occupied by tenants you should see if a check has been carried out. You’ll be responsible for carrying out [further checks on your tenants](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice).

        ^You can read more about the [right to rent documents](/government/publications/rules-and-acceptable-documents-right-to-rent-checks) if you can’t tell what kind of document your tenant is using to rent your property.^
