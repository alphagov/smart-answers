          You should apply for a [Visitor in Transit visa](/transit-visa) if you arrive on a flight and will pass through immigration control before you leave the UK.

          ##Transiting without a visa

          You might be eligible for ‘transit without visa’ if:

          - you arrive and depart by air
          - have a confirmed onward flight that leaves on the day you arrive or before midnight on the day after you arrive
          - have the right documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

          One of the following must also apply:

          - you’re travelling to (or on part of a reasonable journey to) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country %{if_syria}
          - you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country %{if_syria}
          - you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa %{if_syria}
          - you have a residence permit issued by Australia or New Zealand
          - you have a common format residence permit issued by an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland
          - you have a residence permit issued by Canada issued after 28 June 2002
          - you have a uniform format category D visa for entry to a country in the EEA or Switzerland
          - you have an Irish biometric visa and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland
          - you’re travelling from the Republic of Ireland and it’s less than 3 months since you were last given permission, on the basis of holding a valid Irish biometric visa, to land or be in Ireland
          - you have a valid USA permanent residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998
          - you have a valid USA I-551 Temporary Immigrant visa issued by the USA (a wet-ink stamp version will not be accepted)

          - you have a valid standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B issued by the USA (attached to a sealed brown envelope)

          You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules. You can [apply for a transit visa](/transit-visa) before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa.

          %E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.%

          All visas and residence permits must be valid.

          Australian paper confirmation slips are not accepted.
