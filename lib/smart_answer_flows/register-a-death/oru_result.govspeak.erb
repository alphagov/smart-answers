$!You must register the death according to the regulations in the country where the person died. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK. It may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English.

##Register the death with the UK authorities

You can also apply to register the death with the UK authorities. You don’t have to do this, but it means:

- the death will be recorded with the General Register Offices (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and the National Records Office of Scotland
- you can order a consular death registration certificate

You will need to:

s1. Check that you have the right documents.
s2. Print out and fill in the forms.
s3. Pay.
s4. Post your documents and the forms.


###1. Documents

^Send English translations of all foreign documents. <% if translator_link_url %>Use an [approved translator](<%= translator_link_url %>) and include their name and address with your application<% else %>Use a professional translator and include their name and address with your application<% end %>. Don't send laminated documents.^

You must provide:

<% if reg_data_query.class::ORU_DOCUMENTS_VARIANT_COUNTRIES_DEATH.include?(country_of_death) %>
  <% if country_of_death == 'poland' %>

  <% elsif country_of_death == 'papua-new-guinea' %>

- their original full UK birth, naturalisation or registration certificate (if you can’t provide their passport)
- written permission from the person’s next of kin or the executor of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

%Your application will be rejected if the documents aren’t authentic, don’t confirm the person’s identity or don’t prove that they were a British national when they died. The registration fee won’t be refunded.%

###2. Forms

Print out and fill in the [death registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-death).
