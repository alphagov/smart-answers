  You may be able to increase your State Pension based on the National Insurance record
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  The new State Pension will replace the current State Pension system (which includes [basic State Pension](/state-pension) and [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension)).

  The rules for how you can increase your State Pension and what you can inherit will be different depending on when you and your spouse or civil partner reach [State Pension age](/calculate-state-pension).


  You’ll need to know when both you and your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age to use this tool.
