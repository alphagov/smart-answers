    If you’re getting married at the Sharia Court, you’ll need to provide a [single declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-jordan) to prove you’re allowed to marry, or a [single divorced declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-if-you-are-divorced-jordan) if you’re divorced.

    Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

    ^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

    The embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

    If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to the British Embassy in Athens afterwards.

    The embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days (from the day after they receive your payment). They’ll then issue the CNI on the 8th day (as long as nobody has registered an objection).

    There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.

    You can then collect your CNI at the British embassy in Athens or ask for it to be sent to you by post. You must provide the registrar’s original Notice of Marriage if you posted notice in the UK.
