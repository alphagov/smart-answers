    Check with the civil registry  where you’re getting married to find out what certificate you’ll need.

    There are 2 ways you can get these certificates:

    - [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](<%= uk_residence_outcome_path %>)
    - [go to <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %> and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](<%= ceremony_country_residence_outcome_path %>)

    You need to apply for all certificates at least 3 months before the date you intend to get married.

    You must be physically present in Spain for at least 3 days before you apply for a CNI.

    ^Document requirements vary across Spain - check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married to find out what you’ll need.^

    Your partner must also provide their own certificates.

    ## Getting a certificate of no impediment

    Download and complete the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/certificate-of-no-impediment-application-pack) - it contains a list of the documents you’ll need.

    You must sign the notice of marriage and affirmation in front of a local [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) in Spain before you send your application to the consulate.

    Send all the documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

    ###What happens next

    The consulate will check your forms and documents. Once everything is approved, they’ll take your payment and display your notice of marriage for 7 days. If nobody raises an objection, they’ll then issue your CNI and send it to you with your original documents by registered post.

    It takes 10 working days after payment for the consulate to process your application.
