Same-sex relationships in Sweden that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’registrerat partnerskap’, or ’registered partnership’.

Contact the relevant local authorities in Sweden to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You should also check the [travel advice for Sweden](/foreign-travel-advice/sweden).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Sweden.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
