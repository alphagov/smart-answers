## Before you start

You can either get married or have a civil partnership ('pacte civil de solidarité' or PACS).

Contact the [local town hall ('commune')](http://www.guichet.public.lu/citoyens/fr/support/communes/liste/index.php) to find out about local laws, including what documents you'll need.

^Check the [travel advice for Luxembourg](/foreign-travel-advice/luxembourg) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

## Prove you're free to get married

You need to go to the embassy in Luxembourg to confirm that you're legally allowed to get married or have a civil partnership. This is called swearing an affirmation or affidavit. If your partner is also British, they'll need to swear their own affirmation.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay by card (Mastercard or Visa) or with the exact amount of cash in [euros](/government/publications/luxembourg-consular-fees).

### Swearing an affirmation or affidavit

s1. [Make an appointment at the embassy in Luxembourg](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-luxembourg/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to swear your affirmation or affidavit.
s2. Download the [affirmation or affidavit](/government/publications/luxembourg-affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-forms).
s3. Print it out but don't sign it - you need to sign it at the embassy.

You also need to take:

- your passport
- evidence if you've changed your name by deed poll
- proof of your address, your 'Certificat de Résidence', a bank statement or utility bill if you live in Luxembourg
- a boarding pass, hotel receipt or other travel documentation to show that you've been in the country for 3 full days, if you don't live in Luxembourg

### If you've been in a marriage or civil partnership before

You'll need to take one of the following documents:

- original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this might be a PDF certified in the country where you got divorced)
- annulment certificate
- civil partnership dissolution
- partner's [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate

You can provide copies of a decree or death certificate instead of originals. They'll need to be certified by a notary public or solicitor in the country where the divorce took place or the death was registered.

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you'll need evidence that you or your former partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

## Get married or enter into a PACS

Take your affirmation or affidavit to the town hall to be checked. They'll give you a date for the ceremony.

## After you get married

You don't need to register your marriage in the UK. It should be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Luxembourg
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

## After you enter into a PACS

Civil partnerships are only recognised in the UK if they're between same-sex couples.

If your partner isn't British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.
