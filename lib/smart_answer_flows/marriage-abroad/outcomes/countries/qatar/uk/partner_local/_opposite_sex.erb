Contact the [Embassy of Qatar](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Qatar](/foreign-travel-advice/qatar) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry. This is called a marital status document.

[Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Qatar](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-doha/marital-status-document/slot_picker) to get a marital status document. You’ll need:

- your passport
- a copy of your partner’s passport
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you have dual nationality and entered Qatar on your non-British passport, you’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit from the embassy of that country.

Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation or affidavit if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document from their embassy.

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time of the divorce.^

If your documents aren’t in English, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) as well as the originals.

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
