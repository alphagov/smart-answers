Contact the relevant local authorities in Denmark to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Denmark](/foreign-travel-advice/denmark) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You need a certificate of marital status from the [Agency of Family Law](https://familieretshuset.dk/en). It's valid for 4 months. You'll have to pay a fee.

You should apply for a document showing that you’re free to marry from the General Register Office, National Records of Scotland or nidirect.

If you can’t apply for one of these documents you can get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the British Embassy or UK registrar.

###Document showing that you’re free to marry

If you are from England or Wales, you can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. ‘No trace letters’ cost £50 for each 10 year period from age 16 or when you entered the country. Specify how many years you need the search to cover and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’. It can take up to 3 weeks for a ‘no trace letter’ to be issued.

If you are from Scotland, you can get a ’to whom it may concern’ letter from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-abroad/what-documents-will-i-need-to-provide).

If you are from Northern Ireland, you can get a ‘certificate of legal capacity to marry' or a ‘marriage index search’ from [nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/marriage-outside-uk).

###Certificate of no impediment (CNI)

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/denmark/uk/partner_local/opposite_sex)
- [go to Denmark and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/denmark/ceremony_country/partner_local/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
