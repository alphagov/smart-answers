Contact the [High Commission of Malaysia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Malaysia](/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia) before making any plans.

The UK does not issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

The British High Commission in Malaysia can provide you with a letter explaining this position for a charge - see [consular fees for Malaysia](/government/publications/malaysia-consular-fees).

[Make an appointment at the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-high-commission-kuala-lumpur/providing-an-informative-note/slot_picker) to get your letter.

You’ll need to provide the following documents:

- a statutory declaration made at the local High Court or at the office of a notary public in the UK or Malaysia
- your original passport and your partner’s passport
- a divorce certificate (if you have been previously married)

^You must get married through an Islamic ceremony in Malaysia if you or your partner is a Muslim. Otherwise, you’ll need to have a civil marriage.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
