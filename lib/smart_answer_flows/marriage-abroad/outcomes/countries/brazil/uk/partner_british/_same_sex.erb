Same-sex relationships in Brazil that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’união estável’, or ’stable union’.

You should check the [travel advice for Brazil](/foreign-travel-advice/brazil).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Brazil.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

For your CNI to be valid in Brazil, you’ll need to get it:

-	‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) in the UK
-	translated by a sworn translator in Brazil – [find a translator](government/publications/brazil-list-of-lawyers) or search for a ‘tradutor’ through the [local state department](http://www.mdic.gov.br/index.php/micro-e-pequenas-empresa/drei/drei-bne) where you want to get married

You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%
