## Before you start

Contact the [local register office](https://www.mswia.gov.pl/pl/form/148,Adresy-USC-w-Polsce-Addresses-of-Civil-Registry-Offices.html) or church where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to get a CNI to prove you’re legally allowed to get married.
 
You can either get a CNI in:
 
- [the UK](/marriage-abroad/y/poland/uk/opposite_sex)
- [Poland](/marriage-abroad/y/poland/ceremony_country/opposite_sex)
