## Before you start

Contact the local town hall (‘dímos’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^ Check the [travel advice for Greece](/foreign-travel-advice/greece) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans. ^

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) which proves that you’re legally allowed to get married.

If your partner is British, they’ll need to follow the same process to get their own CNI. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.

### Get a CNI

To get a CNI, [make an appointment at the British Embassy in Athens](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-athens/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker) to give notice of your marriage. 

^You can also give notice at the vice consulate in [Crete](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-vice-consulate-crete/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker), [Corfu](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-vice-consulate-corfu/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker), [Rhodes](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-vice-consulate-rhodes/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/company_list) or [Zakynthos](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-vice-consulate-zakynthos/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker). You can arrange for the CNI to be sent to you (for a fee) or you can collect it in Athens.^

You need to be in Greece for 3 full days before you can give notice. This means if you arrive on Monday you can’t give notice until Friday.

It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:receiving_notice_of_marriage) %> to give notice and <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:issuing_cni_or_nulla_osta) %> for the CNI. You can pay by card. If you want to pay in cash you need to pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/greece-consular-fees). 

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- a copy of your partner’s passport or Greek identity card
- [notice of marriage](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [affidavit or affirmation for marriage](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) - you can fill in (but don’t sign) in advance
- a residency or tax certificate or recent utility bill in your name (if you live in Greece)
- proof that you’ve been in Greece for at least 3 full days (if you don’t live in Greece) - for example a boarding pass or a hotel booking confirmation

### If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll need to take one of the following documents:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF certified in the country where you got divorced)
- your annulment certificate
- your civil partnership dissolution
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll also need evidence that you or your former partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

If your document is not in English or Greek you’ll need to get it translated by a [Greek translation service](http://www.mfa.gr/en/citizen-services/translation-service/translation-service.html) or a [private official translator](/government/publications/translators-and-interpreters-list). You’ll be charged for translating your documents.

You might also be asked to get your document [legalised](/get-document-legalised).

###After you give notice

The British embassy or vice consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 full days. This means if you give notice on Monday, it will be displayed until the following Tuesday. 

If nobody registers an objection, your CNI should be ready to collect from the embassy in Athens within 2 weeks of giving your notice. You can also pay to have it sent to you by post or courier.

You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is displayed.

Your CNI will be in Greek. It’ll usually be valid at the town hall for 6 months.

### If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents doesn’t appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to provide evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). 

If you don’t provide evidence, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

## Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI to the person who’s going to marry you. This will be a:

- priest if you’re having a religious ceremony
- registrar at the town hall if you’re having a civil ceremony

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Greece
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the local town hall. 

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
