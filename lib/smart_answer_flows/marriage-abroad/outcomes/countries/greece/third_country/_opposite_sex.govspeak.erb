## Before you start

Contact the local town hall (‘dímos’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^ Check the [travel advice for Greece](/foreign-travel-advice/greece) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans. ^

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re legally allowed to get married.

You can either get a CNI in:

- [the UK](/marriage-abroad/y/greece/uk/opposite_sex)
- [Greece](/marriage-abroad/y/greece/ceremony_country/opposite_sex)


*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
