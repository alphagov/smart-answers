##Before you start

Contact the local district office (‘amphur’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

In most provinces you’ll need a certified copy of your passport to get married.

##What you’ll need to do

To prove you can legally get married in most provinces, you’ll need to:

- apply for an affirmation of marriage
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation of marriage at the British embassy in Bangkok
- get your affirmation of marriage translated into Thai and ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand
- get a certified copy of your passport

If you and your partner are both British, you both need to apply for and swear an affirmation of marriage separately.

##Apply for an affirmation of marriage

You need to bring an affirmation of marriage to your appointment at the embassy.

You can apply for an affirmation of marriage online or with a paper form.

###Apply for an affirmation of marriage online

You can only apply online if you have a UK passport. It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage)%> per person.

To apply for an affirmation of marriage online, you'll need:

- a photo of your UK passport
- your partner’s passport or Thai ID number
- your parents' full name
- name and address of 2 referees who do not live in Thailand

You need to:

- download an [application pack](/government/publications/information-for-british-nationals-intending-to-marry-in-thailand)
- print it out but do not sign the affirmation - you’ll need to sign it at the embassy in Bangkok when you swear your affirmation

##Book an appointment at the British Embassy in Bangkok

You need to go to the British Embassy in Bangkok to swear your affirmation.

You’ll need to [book an appointment online](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=53&service=15).

###What to bring to your appointment

You need to bring several documents to your appointment. If any of your documents were issued outside the UK or Thailand, they must be ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand](http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/16265-Naturalization-Legalization.html).

If your affirmation or documents are not in English, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers) into Thai as well as the originals.

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- your application pack with the affirmation, if you applied using the paper form

If you’ve changed your name by deed poll, you also need to bring evidence of your change of name.

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate and your marriage certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate)  - if you’ve been widowed

If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.

##Translate and legalise your affirmation

You’ll need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers) into Thai and ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand](http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/16265-Naturalization-Legalization.html).

## Get married

You should take your affirmation to the district office where you’re getting married. The registrar will marry you and give you 2 identical marriage certificates in Thai.

You can also pay a fee for the registrar to marry you at your chosen wedding venue.

^Religious ceremonies aren’t valid on their own. The registrar must marry you.^

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Thailand
- it would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
