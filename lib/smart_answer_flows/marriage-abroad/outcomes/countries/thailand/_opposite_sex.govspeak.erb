## Before you start

Contact the local district office (‘amphur’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

In most provinces you’ll need a certified copy of your passport to get married.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to swear an affirmation that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/thailand-consular-fees) with cash or card.

s1. Download an [application pack](/government/publications/information-for-british-nationals-intending-to-marry-in-thailand).
s2. Print it out but do not sign the affirmation - you’ll need to sign it at the embassy.
s3. [Make an appointment at the embassy in Bangkok](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-bangkok/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits-2/slot_picker) to swear your affirmation.

^Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document.^

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- your application pack
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

If your documents were issued outside the UK or Thailand, they must be certified by the country’s embassy in Thailand. If they aren’t in English, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers) as well as the originals.

### Translate and legalise your affirmation

You’ll need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers) into Thai and ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/16265-Naturalization-Legalization.html) in Thailand.

## Get married

You should take your affirmation to the district office where you’re getting married. The registrar will marry you and give you 2 identical marriage certificates in Thai.

You can also pay a fee for the registrar to marry you at your chosen wedding venue.

^Religious ceremonies aren’t valid on their own. The registrar must marry you.^

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Thailand
- it would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
