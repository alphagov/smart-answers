## Before you start

Contact the [civil registry office](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC&lang=en_gb) where you're planning to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

%One of you must live in Spain or be a Spanish national.%

## Prove you're free to get married

What you need varies across Spain.

If you're getting married in Barcelona city and applying to the Central Civil Registry, you'll need a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example). 

If you're getting married elsewhere, the civil registry office will ask for one or both of the following:

- a [certificate of no impediment (CNI)](/government/publications/example-certificate-of-no-impediment-cni)
- a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example)

Show these example certificates to the civil registry where you’re getting married and ask them which you need.

If your partner is British they'll need to make a separate application to the consulate with the same certificates. If they're not British they'll need equivalent documents from their local authorities.

^ Apply for all your certificates at least 3 months before you take your documents to the civil registry appointment. You need to present all your paperwork when you open the marriage application at the civil registry office.

The civil registry office will also ask you for proof of your address. This could be:

- a utility bill or bank statement - if you don't live in Spain
- your registration certificate (‘padrón’) from the town hall ('ayuntamiento') - if you live in Spain

If you've lived in Spain for less than 2 years, you might also need to provide the ['communication proof of address'](/government/publications/communication-regarding-proof-of-address-spain).

### Get a CNI  ('capacidad matrimonial')

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage.
