Contact the relevant local authorities in Romania to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI you must post notice of your intended marriage in Romania. You can do this at the British embassy or have your notice of marriage and affidavit for marriage witnessed in front of a notary public.

You’ll need to have been living in Romania for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

###Post notice at the British Embassy

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Bucharest.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-bucharest/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

###Post notice in front of a notary public

You can have your notice of marriage and affidavit for marriage witnessed by a [Romanian notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) instead. You’ll have to pay a fee.

You’ll need to download a [certificate of no impediment application pack](/government/publications/certificate-of-no-impediment-application-pack-romania). Don’t fill in or sign the forms before your appointment.

Check with the notary if they want electronic copies of the forms before your appointment.

Complete and sign the forms in front of the notary. Then send the signed documents and supporting documents to the embassy.

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Romania.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
