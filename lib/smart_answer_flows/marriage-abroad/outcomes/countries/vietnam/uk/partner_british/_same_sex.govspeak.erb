^You can only register your marriage at the British Embassy in Hanoi.^ 

##What documents you’ll need

You and your partner will need to sign a declaration and provide proof of residence for example, an employer’s letter, a bank statement or your flight ticket.

You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

Foreign documents, for example certificates of no impediment (CNI) or divorce certificates, must be translated into English and certified by a qualified translator.  

###What documents your partner will need

Your partner will need to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove they're legally allowed to get married. They can get this from the local authorities in their country or their countries embassy in Vietnam.

##What you need to do

You’ll both need to be in Vietnam for 7 clear days (not including the date of arrival) before your appointment to post notice of your intention to marry. At your appointment, the embassy or consulate will give you:

-  a notice of intention to marry
-  a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry

Once you’ve completed these and paid the registration fee, the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

^You must stay in Vietnam while your notice is posted if you're not normally resident in Vietnam.^

As long as nobody registers an objection you can get married.

Before your ceremony, you’ll complete and sign an [affirmation or affidavit](/government/publications/affirmation-affidavit-of-marital-status-vietnam) of marital status in front of a consular officer. You can fill in (but not sign) the form before your appointment.

You’ll need to bring two witnesses to your ceremony - they’ll need to show their photo ID (for example passport or driver’s licence).

You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage and a fee for your marriage.

^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
