Contact the relevant local authorities in Vietnam to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you're allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy in Hanoi or the British Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you're free to marry:

- [make an appointment at the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-general-ho-chi-minh-city/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

At your appointment, you'll complete and sign an [affirmation or affidavit](/government/publications/affirmation-affidavit-of-marital-status-vietnam) of marital status in front of a consular officer. You can fill in (but not sign) the form before your appointment. 

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^

##What happens next

You must present your approved affirmation or affidavit for marriage to a local registrar in Vietnam. They will register the marriage and provide you with a marriage certificate. 

You’ll need to bring your passport. Check with the register what other supporting documents you’ll need.
