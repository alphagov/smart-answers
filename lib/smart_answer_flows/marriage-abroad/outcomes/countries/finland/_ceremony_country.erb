##Before you start

Contact the [relevant local authorities](http://www.maistraatti.fi/en/) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^ You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Finland](/foreign-travel-advice/finland) before making any plans.

##Prove you’re free to get married

You need to swear an affidavit or make an affirmation that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/finland-consular-fees) with cash or card (not Visa Electron).

s1. [Make an appointment at the embassy in Finland](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco#!/british-embassy-helsinki/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to swear your affidavit or make your affirmation.
s2. Download and fill in the [questionnaire](/government/publications/civil-status-questionnaire-finland) to bring to your appointment.
s3. The embassy will contact you to confirm your appointment and any other information you need to bring.

^ Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation if they’re British. If they’re not British or Finnish, they might need an equivalent document from their government.^

You and your partner need to bring:

+ your passport
+ your full birth certificate
+ evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll
+ your [residence document](http://www.migri.fi/en) - if you’re in Finland
+ proof of your residence, for example a residence card or work permit - if you’re in another country

### If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll need to take documents to prove the end of any previous marriages or civil partnerships. Depending on how it ended, this will be:

- an original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this might be a PDF certified in the country where you got divorced and should be accompanied by a
covering letter or email from the court that issued the PDF)
- an annulment certificate
- a civil partnership dissolution
- your husband, wife or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and the marriage certificate

^ If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your former partner lived in (or were a national of) that country at the time.^

This applies to your partner too.

##Get married

You should take your affidavit or affirmation to the register office or other venue where you’re getting married.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

+ you follow the correct process according to the law in Finland
+ it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the register
office or other venue where you got married.
