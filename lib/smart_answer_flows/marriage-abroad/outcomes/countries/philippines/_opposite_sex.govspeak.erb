## Before you start
Contact the [Civil Registrar](https://psa.gov.ph/lcr-directory) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married
You need to swear an affirmation or affidavit that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay:

- in the [local currency](/government/publications/philippines-consular-fees) in cash
- in pounds sterling (£) by Visa or MasterCard

### Swear an affirmation or affidavit

An affidavit is a religious document. If you don’t want to swear a religious oath, you can sign an affirmation instead.

s1. Download an [affirmation or affidavit](/government/publications/marriage-in-the-philippines).
s2. Fill it in on your computer on one side of A4 - the embassy won’t accept it if it’s handwritten.
s3. Print it out but don’t sign it - you’ll need to sign it at the embassy.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Manila](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-manila/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to swear your affirmation or affidavit.

^Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation or affidavit if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document.^

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- your affirmation or affidavit
- proof of your address, for example a utility bill or driving licence
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:


- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed
- the original marriage certificate, Advisory of Marriage and court documents - if the previous marriage was annulled in the Philippines

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time of the divorce.^

If your documents aren’t in English, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) as well as the originals.

## Get married
You should give your affirmation or affidavit to the [local Civil Registrar](https://psa.gov.ph/lcr-directory) when you apply for a marriage licence.

You’ll usually get the marriage licence 10 days after you apply. You can book your wedding once you’ve got it.

The marriage licence is valid for 120 days and can be used anywhere in the Philippines.

## After you get married
Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in the Philippines
- it would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
