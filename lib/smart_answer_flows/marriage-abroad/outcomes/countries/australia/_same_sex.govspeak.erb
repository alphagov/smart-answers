##Before you start
Read the [guidance for the state or territory](http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/relationships/marriage-and-relationships) where you want to get married to find out what you need to do.
^ Check the [travel advice for Australia](/foreign-travel-advice/australia) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##Prove you’re free to get married
The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

##After you get married
Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

+ you follow the correct process according to the law in the Australia
+ it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

*[CNI]: Certificate of No Impediment
