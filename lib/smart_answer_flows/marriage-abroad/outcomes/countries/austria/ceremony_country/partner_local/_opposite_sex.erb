You can get married or enter into a civil partnership in Austria.

Civil partnerships are known as ‘eingetragene Partnerschaft’, or ‘registered partnership’ in Austria. Opposite-sex civil partnerships aren’t recognised in the UK.

Contact the relevant local authorities in Austria to find out about local civil partnership and marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry or enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Austria.

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intention to get married or enter into a civil partnership in Austria. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

You’ll need to have been living in Austria for at least 3 full days before you can post notice. For example, if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Vienna.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-vienna/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

To post notice for marriage you'll need to complete a ['Notice of marriage'](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and an ['Affidavit for marriage’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

To post notice for a civil partnership you'll need to complete both the ['declaration' and 'notice of registered partnership' forms](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/getting-married-in-austria-civil-partnership-forms).

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage or civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

###What happens next

The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.

If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.

^The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.^

The consulate will display your notice of marriage or civil partnership publicly for 7 days.

They’ll then issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection) and send it to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married or having a civil partnership ceremony in Austria.

There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Austria.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to become a British citizen once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years after getting married.

Opposite sex civil partnerships are not legally recognised in the UK.
