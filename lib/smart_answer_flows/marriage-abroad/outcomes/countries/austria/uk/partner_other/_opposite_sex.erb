You can get married or enter into a civil partnership in Austria. 

Civil partnerships are known as ‘eingetragene Partnerschaft’, or ‘registered partnership’ in Austria. Opposite-sex civil partnerships aren’t recognised in the UK.

Contact the [Embassy of Austria](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making plans to find out about local marriage and civil partnership laws, including what documents you’ll need. 

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Austria](/foreign-travel-advice/austria) before making any plans.

##Getting married

###What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Austria to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in Austria at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.

You should also check if it needs to be:

- ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)

You should also check with the local authorities in Austria to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Getting a civil partnership

###What you need to do

To get a CNI for a civil partnership you must [go to Austria and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-abroad/y/austria/ceremony_country/partner_british/opposite_sex).

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to become a British citizen once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years after getting married.

Opposite sex civil partnerships are not legally recognised in the UK.
