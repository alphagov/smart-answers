## Before you start

You can register your civil partnership at the high commission in Cyprus.

If you and your partner don’t live in Cyprus, you need to have been
there for at least 21 days before you can register your civil
partnership. You need to stay in the country for the 21 days.

## Prove you’re free to register a civil partnership

You and your partner need to give notice and sign a declaration that
you’re legally allowed to register a civil partnership.

You need to have been in Cyprus for at least 7 full days before you
can give notice. This means if you arrived on Monday, you can’t give
notice until the following Tuesday.

### Give notice of your civil partnership

[Make an appointment at the high commission](
https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-high-commission-nicosia/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker
) to give notice of your civil partnership and set a date for your
ceremony.

It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:receiving_notice_of_marriage) %>
to give notice. You can pay in the
[local currency](/government/publications/cyprus-consular-fees) in
cash or by bank-issued cheque.

You need to bring:

- your and your partner’s passports
- proof that you’ve been in Cyprus for at least 7 full days, for
  example a utility bill, bank statement, passport stamp or boarding
  pass

If you or your partner have been married or in a civil partnership
before, you’ll also need:

- your [original decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
  (this could be a printed PDF and covering email from the court) - if
  you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
  and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took
place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner
lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

The high commission will display your notice publicly for 14 days. If
nobody registers an objection, you can register your civil partnership
up to 3 months after the end of your notice period.

### Sign a declaration

You and your partner also need to sign a declaration to say that
you’re legally allowed to register a civil partnership. The high
commission will give you the document to sign.

You both need to bring proof that you live in Cyprus or you’ve been
there for at least the last 21 full days. This could be a utility
bill, bank statement, passport stamp or boarding pass.

## Register your civil partnership

Your civil partnership registration will be at the high commission on
the date you agreed.

You’ll need to bring 2 witnesses. Your witnesses must:

- bring photo ID
- be 16 or over
- know you or your partner
- understand English well enough to follow the ceremony and read the
  documents they have to sign

You, your partner and your 2 witnesses will sign the civil partnership register.

It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:registering_marriage) %>
to register your civil partnership. You can also pay
<%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:issuing_civil_partnership_or_marriage_certificate) %>
for a civil partnership certificate if you want one.

You can pay when you give notice or when you register your civil
partnership. You need to pay in the
[local currency](/government/publications/cyprus-consular-fees)
in cash or by bank-issued cheque.

## After you register your civil partnership

Your civil partnership will be registered under UK law, so it will be
recognised in the UK but not in Cyprus or other countries where civil
partnerships aren’t legal.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for
[British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen)
once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
