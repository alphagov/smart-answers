## Before you start

Contact the relevant municipal office in Japan to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^Check the [travel advice for Japan](/foreign-travel-advice/japan) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to go to the embassy in Tokyo to confirm that you’re legally allowed to get married. This is called swearing an affirmation or affidavit. Check with the municipal office how long you can use it to get married.

If your partner is also British, they’ll need to swear their own affirmation.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/japan-consular-fees) with cash or card (Visa or Mastercard).

###Swearing an affirmation or affidavit

s1. [Make an appointment at the embassy in Tokyo](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-tokyo/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/service_list) to swear your affirmation or affidavit.
s2. Download the [affirmation or affidavit](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmation-of-marital-status-japan).
s3. Print it double-sided - it won’t be accepted otherwise.
s4. Fill it in (in English) but don’t sign it - you need to sign it at the embassy.

You also need to take:

- your passport
- your full birth certificate (with your parents’ full names and your mother’s maiden name)
- your residence card, if you live in Japan
- your driving licence, a utility bill or bank statement, as proof of address
- your naturalisation certificate, if you’re naturalised or registered as a British national
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

You can [order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate).

If you don’t have your birth certificate for your appointment at the embassy, you'll need to take it to the municipal office when you get married.

###If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll need to take documentation to show the end of any previous marriages or civil partnerships. Depending on how it ended, this would be:

- the original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF and covering email from the court)
- the annulment certificate
- the civil partnership dissolution
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and your  marriage certificate

You can provide copies of a decree or death certificate instead of originals. They’ll need to be certified by a notary public or solicitor in the country where the divorce took place or the death was registered.

If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your former partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.

If any of these documents are not in English or Japanese, you’ll need to bring an official English translation with the original. There’s a [list of English-speaking translators in Japan](/government/publications/japan-list-of-lawyers).

##Get married

To get married you need to:

s1. Take your documents to the municipal office.
s2. Fill in the ‘Kon-in Todoke’ (a request of registration of marriage).


##After you get married

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK. It should be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Japan
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
