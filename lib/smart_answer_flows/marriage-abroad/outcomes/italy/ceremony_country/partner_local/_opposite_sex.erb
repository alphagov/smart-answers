Contact the local comune (town hall) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a ‘Nulla Osta’ by the authorities in Italy. This is a certificate that proves you’re allowed to marry.

To get a Nulla Osta, you’ll first need to post notice of your intended marriage at the British Embassy in Rome.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Rome.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-rome/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

^You’ll need to have been living in Italy for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

###Applying for a Nulla Osta

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

You will need to provide supporting documents, including:

- you and your partner’s passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- a utility bill, bank statement, official residency certificate, or driving license showing your name and Italian address (if you don’t normally live in Italy you can show a flight ticket or boarding pass with your date of entry or evidence of your hotel check-in)
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

You or your partner will also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence in the country where the divorce or dissolution took place, if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.

^If you’re a woman you must wait 300 days after divorcing or the death of your husband before remarrying.^

###What happens next

The British embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

They'll issue your CNI within 5 working days of the end of the 7-day notice period (as long as nobody has registered an objection). You can collect your CNI in person or have it delivered by post.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
