    You’ll need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the authorities in the UK to prove you’re allowed to register a civil partnership.

      ^Your partner will need to follow the same process to get their own CNI.^

    ^ You’ll need to have been living in Italy for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday. ^

    <%= render partial: "applying_for_a_nulla_osta.govspeak.erb" %>

    You’ll need to complete a [notice for civil partnership](/government/publications/notice-for-registration-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) form and a [civil partnership declaration](/government/publications/declaration-for-formation-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) form.

    You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

    You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

    ^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English or Italian.^

    If you're a woman wishing to remarry or enter a new civil partnership, you must wait 300 days after:

    - divorcing or the dissolution of your civil partnership
    - the death of your husband or civil partner.

  %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%
