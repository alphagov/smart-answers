    If you’re getting married at the Sharia Court, you’ll need to provide a [single declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-jordan) to prove you’re allowed to marry, or a [single divorced declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-if-you-are-divorced-jordan) if you’re divorced.

    Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

    ^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

    For non-Islamic marriages, you’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

    You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 full days.

  <% if calculator.cni_posted_after_14_days? %>
    They’ll post your notice, and as long as nobody has registered an objection after 14 days, they’ll issue your CNI.

  <% end %>

  <% if calculator.ceremony_country == 'tunisia' %>
    You’ll need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in Tunisia at the nearest British embassy to where you’re getting married.

  <% elsif calculator.ceremony_country == 'montenegro' %>
    ###Getting a Montenegrin version of your CNI

    You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in Montenegro at the British Embassy in Podgorica.

    Contact the embassy to make an appointment. You’ll need to pay the fee for issuing a CNI or equivalent - see below. Check with the local authorities to make sure they’ll accept your UK-issued CNI, and whether it needs to be:

    ###Legalisation and translation

    You should check with the local authorities in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> to see if your CNI needs to be:


  <% elsif calculator.ceremony_country == 'greece' %>
    <%= render partial: 'legalisation_and_translation.govspeak.erb' %>
    Your UK-issued CNI should be accepted by the town hall.

    ## What happens next

    If you’re getting married in a registry office, you must give them your CNI at least 2 months before your wedding. If you’re getting married in a church, you can do this 2 days before the wedding.

    You may be asked to provide a copy of your birth certificate. Make sure you send a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) as you won’t get it back.
