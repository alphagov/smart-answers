    <%= country_name_uppercase_prefix %> is an overseas department or territory of France. The rules and requirements for getting married there are similar to France.
  <% end %>


  Contact the local town hall (‘mairie’) where you’re getting married to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

  If you’re not in France, [your closest French embassy](http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger) may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.

  Either you, your partner or one of your parents will need to have been living in the town where you wish to get married for at least 40 days before the ceremony.

  ^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

  ##What you need to do

  You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %>.

  You should check with the mairie in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one.

  ^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

  If you need a certificate of custom, you can get one from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

  Some mairies only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

  ###Applying for a certificate of custom from the British Embassy

  s1. Download the [certificate of custom application form](/government/publications/application-for-a-certificate-of-custom-law-for-marriage-france).
  s2. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.
  s3. You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned by registered post.
  s4. Send your completed form by post to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in Euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form. See fee 11 on [consular fees for France](/government/publications/france-consular-fees) for the current cost.
  s5. The embassy will send your certificate and return your documents between 5 and 7 days after receiving your application. Certificates are issued in French and don’t need to be legalised.

  ^If you both need a certificate of custom, you can apply together, but each partner must provide a completed application form and supporting documents. You’ll have to pay 2 fees but only one return postage fee.^

  ###The certificate of celibacy

  The mairie might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it to the mairie instead.

  ##Naturalisation of your foreign partner if they move to the UK

  If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
