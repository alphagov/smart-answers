    Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

    ^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

    You don’t need a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry if you’re a British national resident outside of the UK. However, you’ll need to apply for an exemption (‘Befreiung von der Beibringung des Ehefähigkeitszeugnisses’).

    The local registry office (‘Standesamt’) where you’re getting married should tell you what to do.

    If the Standesamt does ask you for a CNI (‘Ehefähigkeitszeugnis’), refer them to the relevant part of the [German Civil Code](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1309.html) (‘Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch’). This is published on the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court (‘Oberlandesgericht’) website, but it applies to the whole of Germany.

    Check with the Higher Regional Court where you’re getting married if they don’t accept this.
