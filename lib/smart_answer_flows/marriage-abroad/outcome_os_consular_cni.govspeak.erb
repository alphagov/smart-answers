    You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days.

    If you’re getting married at the Sharia Court, you’ll need to provide a [single declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-jordan) to prove you’re allowed to marry, or a [single divorced declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-if-you-are-divorced-jordan) if you’re divorced.

    Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

    ^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

    You don’t need a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry if you’re a British national resident outside of the UK. However, you’ll need to apply for an exemption (‘Befreiung von der Beibringung des Ehefähigkeitszeugnisses’).

    The local registry office (‘Standesamt’) where you’re getting married should tell you what to do.

    If the Standesamt does ask you for a CNI (‘Ehefähigkeitszeugnis’), refer them to the relevant part of the [German Civil Code](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1309.html) (‘Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch’). This is published on the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court (‘Oberlandesgericht’) website, but it applies to the whole of Germany.

    Check with the Higher Regional Court where you’re getting married if they don’t accept this.

        While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/). The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

      ###What happens next

      The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.

      If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.

      ^The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.^

      The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

      They’ll then send all of your documentation to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %>, who will issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection).

      There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.
