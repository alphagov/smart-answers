  $!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have already been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

  If you're still getting Disability Living Allowance (DLA), when you'll be invited to claim PIP depends on when your DLA ends.

  You must tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if your care or mobility needs change while you are still getting DLA. You’ll be invited to claim PIP if this happens.

  ###Your DLA ends before September 2017

  You'll be told 20 weeks before your DLA ends and invited to claim PIP in most areas.

  ^Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if your DLA payment is due to end in less than 4 weeks and you haven’t received a letter about making a new claim. Your payment may stop if you don’t.^

  ###Your DLA ends after September 2017 or your DLA award has no end date

  You can be contacted any time after 13 July 2015 to claim PIP. This includes if you have a long-term award of DLA or an indefinite award with no end date.

  Not everyone will be contacted to claim PIP right away. You'll continue to get DLA until DWP writes to you about when it will end.
