  $!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

  If your child is still getting Disability Living Allowance (DLA), when they'll be invited to claim PIP depends on:

  - when their DLA ends
  - their postcode area
  - their age
  - if their care and mobility needs change

  ###Your child's DLA ends before September 2017

  Your child will normally get a letter before they turn 16 inviting them to apply for PIP.

  ^Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if your child's sixteenth birthday is in less than 4 weeks and you haven’t received a letter. Your child's payment may stop if you don’t.^

  Your child will also be invited to claim PIP if you tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that their care or mobility needs have changed.
