  ### Tax charge to pay

  <% if calculator.calculate_adjusted_net_income < 50100 %>
    There is no tax charge if your income is below £50,099.
    Your partner (if you have one) may have to pay the charge if their income is higher than yours.

    The estimated tax charge to pay is <%= number_to_currency calculator.tax_estimate, unit: "£", precision: 2 %>.

    <% if calculator.tax_year == "2012" %>
      The tax charge only applies to the Child Benefit received between 7 January and 5 April 2013
        and is based on your estimated adjusted net income of <%= number_to_currency calculator.calculate_adjusted_net_income, unit: "£", precision: 2 %>.
    <% end %>

    <% if calculator.tax_year_incomplete? %>
      This is an estimate based on your adjusted net income of <%= number_to_currency calculator.calculate_adjusted_net_income, unit: "£", precision: 2 %>
        - your circumstances may change before the end of the tax year.

    The calculator includes the most common sources of income and
    allowable deductions. If you think you have income or deductions that
    are not on the calculator, phone the
    [Income Tax helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees)
    to find out if you have to pay the tax charge.

    ### How and when to pay

    To pay the tax charge you must fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year. Follow these steps:

    - [Register for Self Assessment](/register-for-self-assessment) if you don’t already fill in a tax return - you should do this by <%= calculator.sa_register_deadline %>.
    - Fill in the tax return and include the amount of Child Benefit received for the tax year.
    - Send the tax return.
    - Pay the tax you owe.

    There are [deadlines](/self-assessment-tax-return-deadlines) for sending the tax return and paying the tax.

    The person with the highest income pays the tax charge, so use your partner’s income in the calculator if it’s higher than yours.


    ### Your Child Benefit
    You can choose to:

    - [stop getting Child Benefit](/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit) - you must pay any tax you owe
    - carry on getting Child Benefit - for each tax year you get it you must fill in a tax return and pay any tax you owe

    <% if calculator.tax_year == "2012" %>
      Your result for the next tax year may be higher because the tax charge will apply to the whole tax year (and not just 7 January to 5 April 2013).
