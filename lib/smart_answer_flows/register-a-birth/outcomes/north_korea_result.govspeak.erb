  ##Cost

  Service | Fee
  -|-
  Register a birth | £105

  You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

  You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the birth.

  Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk) in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.

  ^Registration can take up to 3 months - your application will be sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London where the birth will be registered.^

  Your documents will be returned to the British Embassy in Pyongyang after the birth has been registered. You’ll also be sent copies of the registration certificate if you’ve paid for them. The embassy will contact you when your documents and certificates are ready for collection.
