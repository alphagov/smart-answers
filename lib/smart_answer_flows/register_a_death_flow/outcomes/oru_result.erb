  $!You must register the death according to the regulations in the country where the person died. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

  This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK. It may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English.

  <% if calculator.died_in_eea_or_switzerland? || calculator.died_in_commonwealth? %>
    You can [report the death to most UK government organisations](/after-a-death/death-abroad) in one go using the Tell Us Once service.
  <% end %>

  ##Register the death with the UK authorities

  You can also apply to register the death with the UK authorities. You do not have to do this, but it means:

  - the death will be recorded with the General Register Offices (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and the National Records Office of Scotland
  - you can order a consular death registration certificate

  You will need to:

  s1. Check that you have the right documents.
  s2. Print out and fill in the forms.
  s3. Pay.
  s4. Post your documents and the forms.


  ###1. Documents

  ^Send English translations of all foreign documents. <% if calculator.translator_link_url %>Use an [approved translator](<%= calculator.translator_link_url %>) and include their name and address with your application<% else %>Use a professional translator and include their name and address with your application<% end %>. Do not send laminated documents.^

  You must provide:

  <% if calculator.oru_documents_variant_for_death? %>
    <% if calculator.country_of_death == 'poland' %>
      - the full local death certificate ('zupelny')
    <% elsif calculator.country_of_death == 'papua-new-guinea' %>
      - the hospital medical death record
    <% end %>
  <% else %>
    - the original local death certificate (not a certificate issued by a doctor)
  <% end %>

  - a photocopy of the photo page of the passport of the person who died
  - their original full UK birth, naturalisation or registration certificate (if you cannot provide their passport)
  - written permission from the person’s next of kin or the executor of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

  %Your application will be rejected if the documents are not authentic, do not confirm the person’s identity or do not prove that they were a British national when they died. The registration fee will not be refunded.%

  ###2. Forms

  Print out and fill in the [death registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-death).

  ###3. Pay

  <% if !calculator.in_the_uk? && calculator.registration_country == 'algeria' %>
    Pay by credit or debit card - fill in the [credit card authorisation slip](/government/publications/credit-card-authorisation-form-algeria) and post it with your registration form.
  <% else %>
    Pay online for the registration. Email <deathregistrationenquiries@fcdo.gov.uk> if you are unable to pay online.
  <% end %>

  <%= render partial: 'fees',
             locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

  <%= render partial: 'shared/births_and_deaths_registration/document_return_fees', locals: { document_return_fees: calculator.document_return_fees } %>
  <%= render partial: 'shared/births_and_deaths_registration/button', locals: { button_data: { text: "Pay now", url: "https://pay-register-death-abroad.service.gov.uk/start" } } %>

  The registration fee does not include any copies of the certificate, but you can order them at the same time. Cheaper copies will be available from the General Register Office in the UK, but only from November the year after you register.

  If you need a copy sooner, email the name of the registered person, the registration date and reference number to <deathregistrationapplications@fcdo.gov.uk>. You’ll get a reply telling you how to get your copy and the cost - usually £50 plus courier fees.

  ###4. Send your registration

  Once you've paid you will be given a reference number to use on your death registration form.
