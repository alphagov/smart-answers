  Some student finance (eg a Maintenance Grant) is based on income.

  You must send your income details for the 2014 to 2015 tax year. Do this online as part of the [student’s application](/apply-online-for-student-finance). If you can’t do it online, use form PFF2.

  If you think your income has dropped by 15% or more since the 2014 to 2015 tax year you’ll need to do both of the following:

  + submit your 2014 to 2015 income details using form PFF2
  + complete a CYI form (to ask for the student finance to be based on your expected 2015 to 2016 tax year income)
