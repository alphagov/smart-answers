    **Coronavirus Job retention scheme**

    If you are an employer with a PAYE scheme, you should be able to access support to continue paying part of your employees’ salary instead of laying them off.

    This applies to employees who have been asked to stop working because of coronavirus, but are being kept on the payroll. They are known as ‘furloughed workers’. HMRC will pay 80% of their wages, up to £2,500 per month.

    This is an automatic offer. You do not need to apply for the deferral, or tell HMRC that you are applying it. If you normally pay by Direct Debit you should contact your bank to cancel your Direct Debit as soon as you can, you do not need to contact HMRC before doing this.
