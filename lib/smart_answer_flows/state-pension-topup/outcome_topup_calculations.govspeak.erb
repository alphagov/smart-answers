  To top up your pension by <%= format_money(weekly_amount) %> per week, you’ll need to make a lump sum payment of either:

  <% amounts_vs_ages.each do |amount_and_age| %>
    - <%= number_to_currency(amount_and_age[:amount], precision: 0) %> when you're <%= amount_and_age[:age] %>
  <% end %>

  Make sure you’ll get the full [basic State Pension](/state-pension-statement) before making Class 3A contributions.

  You should get [financial advice](/plan-retirement-income/get-financial-advice) when planning your retirement income.

  The contribution amount is an estimate.
