  Based on your answers, the expenses you can claim and deduct are listed below. There are 2 sets of results comparing simplified expenses and calculating expenses by working out the actual costs.

  ##Simplified expenses

  <% unless capital_allowance_claimed or simple_vehicle_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(simple_vehicle_costs) %> to claim for cars and vans
  <% end %>

  <% unless simple_motorcycle_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(simple_motorcycle_costs) %> to claim for motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% if list_of_expenses.include?("using_home_for_business") %>
    <% if simple_home_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
      - you have to work at least 25 hours per month from home to use simplified expenses
    <% else %>
      - <%= format_money(simple_home_costs) %> to claim for working from home
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% if (list_of_expenses - ['live_on_business_premises']).empty? %>
    **Total to claim per year:**
  <% else %>
    **Total to claim per year:** <%= format_money(simple_total) %>
  <% end %>

  <% unless simple_business_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(simple_business_costs) %> to deduct from your total business costs - you then claim the balance
  <% end %>

  <% if capital_allowance_claimed %>
    You can’t use simplified expenses for your vehicle because you’ve already claimed Capital Allowances for it.

    You have to continue to calculate your vehicle expenses by working out the actual costs.
  <% end %>

  ###What to do for your tax return

  Use the simplified expenses flat rates to work out your business expenses.

  Multiply the flat rates with the [miles you drove](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-), [hours you work from home](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/business-use-of-your-home) or the [number of people who live on your business premises](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/private-use-of-business-premises).

  ##Calculating expenses by working out the actual costs

  <% unless vehicle_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(vehicle_costs) %> for cars and vans and motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% unless green_vehicle_write_off.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(green_vehicle_write_off) %> for cars, vans and motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% unless dirty_vehicle_write_off.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(dirty_vehicle_write_off) %> for for cars, vans and motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% unless home_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(home_costs) %> for working from home
  <% end %>

  <% if (list_of_expenses - ['live_on_business_premises']).empty? %>
    **Total to claim per year:**
  <% else %>
    **Total to claim per year:** <%= format_money(current_scheme_costs) %>
  <% end %>

  <% unless simple_business_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(business_premises_cost) %> to deduct from your total business costs - you then claim the balance
  <% end %>

  <% if is_over_limit %>
    The upper limit for Capital Allowance write offs for vans is £250,000.
  <% end %>

  ###What to do for your tax return

  You’ll have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premises use.

  You’ll then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and [keep records](/self-employed-records) for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills.
