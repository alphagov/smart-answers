<% content_for :body do %>
  Get an estimate of how much you’ll need to pay in penalties and interest if you’ve missed the deadline for:

  - sending your Self Assessment tax return
  - paying your Self Assessment tax bill

  This calculator can only give an estimate of what you owe and does not take account of:

    - payments you’ve made towards your tax bill
    - outstanding interest or penalties for previous tax years
    - credit you have from previous tax years

  Do not use the calculator if you:

    - got your request to fill in a Self Assessment less than 3 months before the deadline, so had more time to file it
    - sent a paper return after October 31, but HMRC agreed you had a reasonable excuse to not file online
