  Will you pass through UK border control?
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>

  You always pass through border control if you:

  - leave the main airport building for any reason
  - need to collect your bags and check them in to your onward flight

  You must also pass through border control if both:

  - your onward flight leaves on a different calendar day to when you arrive
  - there’s nowhere for you to stay overnight in the airport, for example in a transit hotel

  ^Check with your airline if you’re not sure if you’ll pass through border control.^
