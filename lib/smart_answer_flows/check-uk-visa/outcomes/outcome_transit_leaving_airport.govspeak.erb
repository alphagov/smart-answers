  - you have a residence permit issued by Australia or New Zealand
  - you have a common format residence permit issued by an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland
  - you have a residence permit issued by Canada issued after 28 June 2002
  - you have a uniform format category D visa for entry to a country in the [EEA](/eu-eea) or Switzerland
  - you have an Irish biometric visa and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland
  - you’re travelling from the Republic of Ireland and it’s less than 3 months since you were last given permission, on the basis of holding a valid Irish biometric visa, to land or be in Ireland
  - you have a valid USA I-551 Temporary Immigrant visa issued by the USA (a wet-ink stamp version will not be accepted)
  - you have a valid USA permanent residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998

  - you have a valid standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B issued by the USA (attached to a sealed brown envelope)

  You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force Officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules. You can [apply for a transit visa](/transit-visa) before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa.

  %E-visas or e-residence permits aren’t acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.%

  All visas and residence permits must be valid.
