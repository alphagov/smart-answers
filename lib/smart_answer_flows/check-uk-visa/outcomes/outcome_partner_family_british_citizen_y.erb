  Apply for a [family visa](/uk-family-visa).

  Or you may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit/eu-settlement-scheme-family-permit) instead. Your close family member must be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein and have been living in the UK before 31 December 2020.

  The family permit lets you live, work and study in the UK for up to 6 months. You may then be able to apply to the free EU Settlement Scheme to stay longer in the UK.
