  ##Working Tax Credit

  You could get [Working Tax Credit](/working-tax-credit) if you either:

  - live in Switzerland or an [European Economic Area](/eu-eea) (EEA) country and travel to the UK to work
  - travel abroad to work, but are ‘ordinarily resident' in the UK

  ^Ordinarily resident means you normally live in the UK, and plan to stay for the time being.^

  ##Child Tax Credit

  You could get [Child Tax Credit](/child-tax-credit) if:

  - you are ordinarily resident in the UK
  - you work in the UK and pay [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) here

  Contact the Tax Credits Helpline to claim.
