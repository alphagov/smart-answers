  ## How long it takes

    If you haven’t already reported the loss or theft, you must include [form LS01](/government/publications/lost-or-stolen-passport-notification--2) with your passport application.

  You may have to attend an interview.

  Applications will take longer if:

  - Her Majesty’s Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents
  - the photographs you send are rejected

  Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an [Emergency Travel Document.](/emergency-travel-document)
