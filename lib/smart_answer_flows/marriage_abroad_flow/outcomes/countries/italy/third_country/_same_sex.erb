## Before you start

Contact the local Italian town hall (‘comune’) to find out about local civil partnership laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

## Prove you’re free to register a civil partnership

To prove you’re legally allowed to register a civil partnership, you’ll need to either:

- go to the UK and [get a CNI](/marriage-abroad/y/italy/uk/same_sex)
- go to Italy and [get a Nulla Osta](/marriage-abroad/y/italy/ceremony_country/same_sex)

^Your partner will also need a CNI and statutory declaration or a Nulla Osta if they’re British. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.^
