      Your <%= type %> can be legalised if it is either:

      - an official certified copy of the certificate issued by the General Register Office (GRO) with the original seal
      - an original certificate (or original certified copy) issued by a local register office, with the original signature of the official who issued the certificate

      It can take longer to legalise a signature on an original certificate, especially if it was issued before 1991.

      It might be quicker to order a certified copy of your certificate from the:

      - [GRO (England and Wales)](https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp)
      - [GRO for Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/contacts/opentime/index.html/)

    ##Certifying documents

    If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.

    When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:

    - note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)
    - use their personal signature, not a company signature
    - include the date of certification
    - include their company address

    If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.

    If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.

    You can find:

    - [solicitors in England and Wales](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/home.law)

    - [notaries public in England and Wales](http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/notary/find-a-notary/)
