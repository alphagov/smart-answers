  Based on your answers, you’re affected by the outside London benefit cap.

<%
  new_housing_benefit_amount = config.new_housing_benefit_amount(housing_benefit_amount, total_over_cap)
  new_housing_benefit = config.new_housing_benefit(new_housing_benefit_amount)

  Your weekly benefits | Outside London benefit cap
  -|-
  <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %> | <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>

  Your Housing Benefit will be: <%= format_money(new_housing_benefit) %>.

  ##How this is worked out

  The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over the outside London benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

  Total amount of benefits affected by the outside London cap: <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %>

  Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over the outside London benefit cap of <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>:

  Total benefits affected: <%= format_money(total_benefits_amount) %>

  Minus outside London benefit cap: <%= format_money(benefit_cap) %>

  Total over outside London cap: <%= format_money(total_over_cap) %>

  Housing benefit: <%= format_money(housing_benefit_amount) %>

  Minus total over outside London cap: <%= format_money(total_over_cap) %>

  New Housing Benefit amount: <%= format_money(new_housing_benefit) %>

  <% if new_housing_benefit_amount < 0.5 %>
    Your Housing Benefit won’t be reduced to less than 50p. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.
