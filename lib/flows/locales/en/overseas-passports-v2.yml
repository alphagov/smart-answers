          ## How long it takes
          %{how_long_it_takes}

          Your application may take longer if:

          - you don’t send the right supporting documents or payment
          - the photographs you send are rejected

          Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an [Emergency Travel Document.](/emergency-travel-document)

          ## Cost
          %{cost}

          ## How to apply

          1. Download the application form and guidance notes that help you fill it in.

          2. Include 2 identical new photos of you (or your child, if it’s a child passport application). [Follow the rules about passport photos](/photos-for-passports "Passport photo requirements") or your application may be delayed.

          3. Check the guidance notes to find out which supporting documents you must send with your application. You must get documents that aren’t in English fully translated by a professional translator.
