          $!The child isn't affected by Personal Independence Payment because they're under 16.$!

          To qualify for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) the child must be 16 or over.

          Instead of PIP, you can make a claim for [Disability Living Allowance](/disability-living-allowance-children) for the child until they turn 16.

        body: |
          $!You aren't affected by Personal Independence Payment because you are aged 65 or over.$!

          To qualify for Personal Independence Payment you must be aged 16 to 64.

          Instead of PIP, you can make a claim for [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance "Attendance Allowance") (you won't normally qualify for Disability Living Allowance because you're 65 or over).

          $!You can make a claim for [Personal Independence Payment (PIP)](/pip).$!

          You can no longer make a claim for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) because PIP has replaced DLA for people aged 16 to 64.

          ##After they turn 16

          Most children won't be affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP) until 2015 or later, but there are some exceptions.

          They'll be asked to make a claim for PIP if after October 2013:

          * there’s a change in how their condition affects them
          * their DLA is due to end and they haven't received a renewal letter

          Unless either of these happen – you don't need to do anything. You'll get a letter in 2015 or later explaining:

          * what will happen to their DLA
          * how they can claim PIP

          *[PIP]: Personal Independence Payment
          *[DLA]: Disability Living Allowance

      result_5:
        body: |
          $!You can continue to claim Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for the child until they turn 16.$!

          You don't have to do anything now.

          Closer to their 16th birthday you'll get a letter explaining:

          * what will happen to their DLA
          * how they can claim Personal Independence Payment

          *[DLA]: Disability Living Allowance

          $You aren’t affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

          Because you were aged 65 or over on 8 April 2013 when PIP was introduced, you can continue to get [Disability Living Allowance](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit "Disability Living Allowance") for as long as you're eligible.
