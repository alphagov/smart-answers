        Calculate Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for your employee.

        ##What you need to know

        You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

        - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for your employee (or would do if not for their age or their level of earnings)
        - you don’t provide your own occupational sick pay scheme
        - your employee was sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)
        - your employee has told you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you don’t have one)

        ^ You can’t use the calculator for periods of sickness before 6 April 2011.^

          ##What you need to know

          %{paternity_adoption_warning}

          SSP can be paid for up to 28 weeks of an employee’s normal workdays. For this employee that equals a total of %{pattern_days_total} days. After that you must give them [form SSP1](/employers-sick-pay/eligibility-and-form-ssp1) within 7 days of SSP ending. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA).](/employment-support-allowance)

          There are also [records you must keep](/sick-leave-pay-employees/entitlement) and rules on [proof of illness](/sick-leave-pay-employees/notice-and-fit-notes) you can ask for.

          You may be able to [recover the statutory payments](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/employee/statutory-pay/ssp-calc.htm) you’ve paid from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Your payroll software or [HMRC’s basic PAYE tools](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payerti/payroll/bpt/index.htm) can tell you how much you’ll get back.
