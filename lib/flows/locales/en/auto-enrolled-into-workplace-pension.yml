          You might be able to save a small amount by the time you go home but it could be difficult to transfer the pension pot to your country.

          You can opt out of the UK workplace pension. This means you won’t get the contribution from your employer or tax relief from the UK government.

          If you plan to come back to the UK to work long term, you might want to leave your pension pot here.
