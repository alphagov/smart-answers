        description: Parents must register the birth in the country where the child was born - find out if you can also register the birth in the UK
      body: |
        You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They will give you a local birth certificate.

        Once you’ve done this you may be able to apply to register the birth with the UK authorities.  
        
        You don’t have to do this, but it means:

        - you’ll get a UK-style birth certificate for the child
        - you’ll have proof that the child is a British citizen
        - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Office in the UK

        ^A locally-issued birth certificate should be accepted in the UK for all purposes, eg applying for a passport, registering with a school or doctor etc. It might need to be translated and [certified](/certifying-a-document "Certify a document") if it's not in English.^

          You can’t register your child’s birth with the UK authorities abroad. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

          You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/ "Find out how to register your child as a British citizen"){:rel="external"} for the child.

          You may also be able to register the birth if you’ve married the other parent since the child was born. [Contact your local British embassy](/government/world "Find a British embassy") to find out.

          The local birth certificate, with a [certified translation](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/list-of-lawyers "Find a translator abroad"), should be acceptable for all purposes in the UK. You can apply for registration at any time in the future - check [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice) to find out if consular services have reopened in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix}.
