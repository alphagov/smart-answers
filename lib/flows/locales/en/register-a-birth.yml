        description: Parents must register the birth in the country where the child was born - find out if you can also register the birth in the UK
      body: |
        You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They will give you a local birth certificate.

        Once you’ve done this you may be able to apply to register the birth with the UK authorities.  
        
        You don’t have to do this, but it means:

        - you’ll get a UK-style birth certificate for the child
        - you’ll have proof that the child is a British citizen
        - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Office in the UK

        ^A locally-issued birth certificate should be accepted in the UK for all purposes, eg applying for a passport, registering with a school or doctor etc. It might need to be translated and [certified](/certifying-a-document "Certify a document") if it's not in English.^
