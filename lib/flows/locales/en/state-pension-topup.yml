        From 12 October 2015 to 1 April 2017 you’ll be able to make a ‘Class 3A voluntary contribution’ to top up your State Pension by up to £25 per week.
        
        Calculate how much you’ll need to contribute. You must be:

        - a man born before 6 April 1951
        - a woman born before 6 April 1953

        ###What you need to know
        
        You can choose to top up your State Pension by between £1 and £25 per week. How much you’ll need to contribute depends on:

        - how much extra pension you want to get each week
        - how old you are when you make the contribution

        $E
        **Example**
        You are 68 years old in October 2015. You decide that you want to get an extra £5 per week (£260 a year) on top of your pension.

        The cost of an extra £1 per week for a 68 year old is £827, so you multiply £827 by 5.

        You’ll make a lump sum payment of £4,135.

        ###Eligibility
