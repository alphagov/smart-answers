                    Your entitlement is %{number_of_weeks_entitlement} weeks.

                    For each year of employment you get:

                    + 0.5 week’s pay up to your 22nd birthday
                    + 1 week’s pay after your 22nd birthday
                    + 1.5 weeks’ pay after your 41st birthday

                    Length of service is capped at 20 years and weekly pay at £430.

                    The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £12,900.

                    ^You can’t get less than the statutory amount but you may get more if you have a company redundancy scheme.^
