          ## How accommodation is calculated

          £%{accommodation_rate} x %{accommodation_usage} nights + £%{total_working_pay} total pay / %{total_hours} hours = £%{total_hourly_rate}

          ## How accommodation is calculated

          s1. [rate per day charged for accommodation] x [days accommodation is provided in pay period] = [accommodation charge per pay period]  
          s2. [total pay] - [accommodation charge per pay period] + [£4.82 offset rate x days in pay period] = [total pay]  
          s3. [total pay] / [hours worked in pay period] = [actual pay per hour]
