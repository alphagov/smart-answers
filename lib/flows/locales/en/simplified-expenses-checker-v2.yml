        body: |
          Your circumstances mean that you can’t use [simplified expenses](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses).

          The flat rate simplified expenses are only available for:

          - business use of vehicles
          - business use of your home (eg if you’re working from home)
          - private use of your business premises (eg guesthouses and B&Bs)

          All other expenses you must be [calculated the usual way](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/relief-self-emp.htm) when sending your [Self Assessment tax return](/self-assessment-tax-returns).

          ##Simplified expenses

          %{simplified_bullets}

          **Total to claim per year:** %{simple_total}

          %{simplified_more_bullets}

          %{capital_allowances_claimed_message}

          ###What to do for your tax return

          Using [flat rates simplified expenses](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/overview) when calculating your taxable profit may be easier for you because you don’t have to work out the split between private and business use.

          Instead you just multiply the flat rates with the [miles you drove](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-), [hours you use your home for business](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/business-use-of-your-home) or the [number of people who live on your business premises](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/private-use-of-business-premises).

          %{over_van_limit_message}

          ###What to do for your tax return

          You’ll have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premise use.

          You’ll then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and [keep records](/self-employed-records) for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills.

          ^This is an estimate. You should do your own calculations for your tax return.^

      capital_allowance_result:
        body: |
          You can’t use simplified expenses for your current vehicle because you’ve already claimed Capital Allowances for it.

          You should continue to claim your actual vehicle expenses, and [Capital Allowances](/capital-allowances) where relevant.

          If you get a new vehicle and use it for your business, you can claim flat rate simplified expenses for it if it suits you.
