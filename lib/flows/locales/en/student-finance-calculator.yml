        This tool is for students from England starting their course on or after **1 September 2012**.

        It estimates what loans, grants and extra help you can get - eg if you're disabled or have children.

        ##What you need to know
        Your result will be more accurate if you know your household income (your parents' or partner's income plus your own).
