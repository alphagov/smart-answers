USAGE: flow_audit <path/to/my_flow.rb>

The flow auditor scans the given flow file using the ruby parser. It checks
for old-style next_node blocks which return a symbol and attempts to determine
the possible next nodes by looking for the possible symbols returned by its
block.

For each old style next_node block it will print out the file and line number
of the invocation, a list of the undeclared next node symbols, and a sample
invocation of the permitted_next_nodes function to declare them.

e.g.

$ ./bin/flow_audit lib/flows/register-a-birth.rb
lib/flows/register-a-birth.rb:15:1
  country_select(country_of_birth?)
  Missing: no_embassy_result, commonwealth_result, who_has_british_nationality?

permitted_next_nodes(:no_embassy_result, :commonwealth_result, :who_has_british_nationality?)

END_USAGE
  exit(1)
