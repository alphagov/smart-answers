Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at this embassy. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n\n<p>Access to the embassy for wheelchairs is through the front entrance on Thomas Heftyes gate 8. This entrance is located on a quiet road which is usually clear and unobstructed. Although there are no ramps, the ground surface is safe and secure.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the embassy, doors are wide enough for wheelchair access and there is a lift to all floors which is fully accessible to wheelchair users. Please contact our reception on +47 23 13 27 00 if you are arriving by car and would like assistance on arrival. Our security guards and staff will be happy to help.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-for-visually-impaired-visitors\">Access for visually impaired visitors</h3>\n<p>Guide dogs are welcome.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-for-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing-visitors\">Access for deaf and hard of hearing visitors</h3>\n<p>Hearing dogs are welcome.</p>\n</div>",
