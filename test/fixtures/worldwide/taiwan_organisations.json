The British Office Taipei is housed on the 26th floor of a 30-storey building. The building management has installed ramps giving wheelchair users access to the building from the main street.</p>\n\n<p>Once inside the building, all visitors must obtain an access card which allows them to use the lifts. These are obtainable from dedicated terminals to the left of the main entrance. Visitors should use the terminals to call the British Office Taipei receptionist who will authorise the terminal to issue a card. If, as a disabled visitor, you have difficulty using the terminals, please approach the building security or reception for assistance. Alternatively, telephone the British Office Taipei reception at 02 8758 2088 for help.</p>\n\n<p>There are no internal steps in our offices and there is wide access for visitors to our Visa Section. There is a lavatory for disabled users inside the British Office Taipei.</p>\n\n<p>In emergencies, disabled visitors may either be evacuated by the fire brigade from the 26 floor or helped evacuate by members of staff to using the specially made transit chair down the emergency stairs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contact-us\">Contact us</h2>\n\n<p>If you need to visit us or feel that you may have accessibility difficulties, please contact the Corporate Services Section on 02 8758 2088 for assistance.</p>\n\n<p>For consular enquiries, please email to <a href=\"mailto:Bass.Taipei@fco.gov.uk\">British Assistance and Services Section</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-holidays\">2018 Public holidays</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Monday 1 January - New Year</li>\n  <li>Thursday 15 - Tuesday 20 February - Lunar New Year Holiday</li>\n  <li>Wednesday 28 February - Peace Memorial Day</li>\n  <li>Friday 30 March - Good Friday</li>\n  <li>Monday 02 April - Easter Monday</li>\n  <li>Thursday 05 April - Tomb Sweeping Day</li>\n  <li>Monday 18 June - Dragon Boat Festival</li>\n  <li>Monday 24 September - Mid-Autumn Festival</li>\n  <li>Wednesday 10 October - Taiwanese National Day</li>\n  <li>Tuesday 25 - Wednesday 26 December - Christmas Holidays</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-holidays-1\">2019 Public holidays</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Tuesday 1 January  - New Year</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Monday 4 - Thursday 7 February - Lunar New Year Holiday</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Thursday 28 February - Peace Memorial Day</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Friday 5 April - Tomb Sweeping Day</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Friday 19 April - Good Friday</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Monday 22 April - Easter Monday</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Friday 7 June - Dragon Boat Festival</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Friday 13 September - Mid-Autumn Festival</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Thursday 10 October - Taiwanese National Day</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Wednesday 25 - Thursday 26 December - Christmas Holidays</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
