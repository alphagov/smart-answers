Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes, however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled staff and visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at the High Commission. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General Physical Access</h3>\n\n<p>If you anticipate requiring assistance, please telephone us in advance of your visit so that we can ensure that we are able to provide access for you (tel: 6424 4200 and ask for the Security Manager).</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Steps &amp; Staircases: all steps and staircases (including fire exits) have at least one set of rails.
