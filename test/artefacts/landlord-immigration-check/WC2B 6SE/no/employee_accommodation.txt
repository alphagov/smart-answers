You don’t have to make a check on the person if you’re providing accommodation as a part of training or employment.

You will have to carry out a check on any adult dependents of the person if they aren’t being trained or employed.

As the property you're renting out is in England you need to check tenancies that start on or after 1 February 2016. 

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
