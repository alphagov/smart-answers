You don’t have to make a check if the student is in:

- a halls of residence
- any accommodation provided by their educational institution
- any private accommodation agreed between the educational institution and the landlord

You’ll have to carry out a check in all other cases.

As the property you're renting out is in England you need to check tenancies that start on or after 1 February 2016. 

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
