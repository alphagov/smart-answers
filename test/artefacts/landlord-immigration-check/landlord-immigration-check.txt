Check if someone can rent your residential property

Find out if someone can rent private residential property in England.

You must check anyone aged 18 or over who pays to use your property as their main home, eg tenants, sub-tenants and paying house guests.

You must check tenancies which start on or after 1 February 2016.

In Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Dudley or Wolverhampton, check tenancies that started on or after 1 December 2014.

If you’ve bought a property that is already occupied by tenants you should see if a check has been carried out. You’ll be responsible for carrying out [further checks on your tenants](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice).
