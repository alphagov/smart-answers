You don’t need to make a check if both of the following apply:

- you're letting the property for holiday or leisure
- you're letting the property to the person for under 3 months

You’ll have to make a check if:

- you’re letting the property to the same person for longer than 3 months
- the booking for the property is open-ended
- you’ve extended the time the person has booked the property more than once

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
