You don’t need to make right to rent check if the person is staying in a hostel or refuge:

- that is managed by a social landlord, voluntary organisation or charity
- that isn’t operated as a commercial basis
- that is partly or wholly funded by a government department, agency or local authority

You’ll have to carry out a check in all other cases.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
