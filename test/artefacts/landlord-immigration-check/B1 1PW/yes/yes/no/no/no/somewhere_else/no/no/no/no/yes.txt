You must get a positive verification from the [Landlords Checking Service](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-application.ofml) that the person can rent the property if:

- you're reasonably satisfied that they can't show you their documents because of an outstanding immigration appeal, administrative review or application with the Home Office
- they have an Application Registration Card
- they have a Certificate of Application that is less than 6 months old

The person will be able to stay in the property for 12 months. The verification letter will tell you when you have to make another check.

##When the person can't rent your property

The person won’t be able to rent the property if:

- they don’t have the right documents
- you get a negative result back from the verification check

^You may get a [civil penalty](/penalties-illegal-renting) if you get a Negative Verification notice and you still rent your property to the person who isn't allowed to rent property in the UK.^

As the property you're renting out is in Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Dudley or Wolverhampton you need to check tenancies that started on or after 1 December 2014.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
