You must [check with the Home Office](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/lcs-application.ofml) to find out if the person is allowed to rent property. You’ll need their Home Office reference number.

You’ll get an answer within 2 working days.

If the person’s allowed to rent, the Home Office will tell you if you need to check their documents again later.

^You may get a [civil penalty (fine)](/penalties-illegal-renting) if the person isn’t allowed to rent but you still rent your property to them.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
