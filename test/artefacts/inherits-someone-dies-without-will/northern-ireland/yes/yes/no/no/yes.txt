The husband, wife or civil partner keeps all the assets (including property) up to £450,000, and all the personal possessions, whatever their value.

The husband, wife or civil partner must survive the deceased by at least 28 days to inherit.

They also get half the amount left over.

The remainder is divided between any brothers or sisters.

If any brother or sister is dead, their children (the deceased’s nieces and nephews) inherit.
