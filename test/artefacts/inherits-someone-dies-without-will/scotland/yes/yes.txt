The husband, wife or civil partner gets the house up to a value of £473,000. They’ll get a lump sum of £473,000 if the house is worth more, and may have to sell off the property.

They also get:

- furniture and moveable household goods up to the value of £29,000
- up to £50,000 in cash
- a third of the rest of the estate

The children will get two-thirds of the rest of the estate.

If a son or daughter has already died, their children (the grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit in their place.
