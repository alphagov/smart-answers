Based on the answers you’ve given, you won’t be affected by the benefit cap. This is because the total amount of benefits you get are less than the benefit cap.

##How this is worked out

The total amount of your benefits are added together:

Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £307

As this amount is lower than your benefit cap of £384, your benefits won’t change.

This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.
