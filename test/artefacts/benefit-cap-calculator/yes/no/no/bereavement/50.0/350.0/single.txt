Based on the answers you’ve given, you will be affected by the benefit cap as you get £400.00 in benefits and your benefit cap is £350.00.

This means your Housing Benefit will now be: £300.00.

##How this is worked out

The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over your benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £400.00

Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over your benefit cap of £350.00:

Total benefits affected: £400.00

Minus benefit cap: £350.00

Total over cap: £50.00

Housing benefit: £350.00

Minus total over cap: £50.00

New Housing Benefit amount: £300.00
