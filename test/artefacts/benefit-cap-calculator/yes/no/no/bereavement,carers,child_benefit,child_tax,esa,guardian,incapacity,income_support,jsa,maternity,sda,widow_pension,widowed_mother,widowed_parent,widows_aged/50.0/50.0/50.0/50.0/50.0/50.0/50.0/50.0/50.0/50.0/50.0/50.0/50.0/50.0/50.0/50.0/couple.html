          <p>This means your Housing Benefit will now be: £0.50.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-is-worked-out">How this is worked out</h2>

<p>The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over your benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:</p>

<p>Total amount of benefits affected by cap: £800.00</p>

<p>Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over your benefit cap of £500.00:</p>

<p>Total benefits affected: £800.00</p>

<p>Minus benefit cap: £500.00</p>

<p>Total over cap: £300.00</p>

<p>Housing benefit: £50.00</p>

<p>Minus total over cap: £300.00</p>

<p>New Housing Benefit amount: £0.50</p>

<p>Your Housing Benefit won’t be reduced to 0. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.</p>

<p>This is an estimate only. Contact the Department for Work and Pensions if you need further help.</p>
