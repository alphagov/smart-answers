          <p>Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.</p>

<p>Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate</li>
  <li>you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed</li>
</ul>

<p>This is also known as the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm">married women’s reduced rate election</a> (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.</p>
</div>

<p>The Reduced Rate Election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2018. This is in the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018.</p>

<p>You got married in 1975 and chose to to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.</p>

<p>Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in 1982.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="what-you-may-get-if-you-have-a-reduced-rate-election">What you may get if you have a reduced rate election</h2>

<p>You’ll get a pension that will be about the same as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the full rate of the basic State Pension (under the current State Pension rules)</li>
  <li>any Additional State Pension you built up before 6 April 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll get this when you reach State Pension age.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t need to have the minimum of 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get a State Pension if you’re eligible under these different rules.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll get more if your <a href="/new-state-pension">State Pension</a> is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-remarry-or-form-a-new-civil-partnership-before-you-reach-state-pension-age">If you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age</h3>

<p>You’ll get a pension that is about the same as the lower rate current system basic State Pension of £67.8 a week and any Additional State Pension you built up before 6 April 2016.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get more if your <a href="/new-state-pension">State Pension</a> is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your pension must have been calculated under the reduced rate election rules for this to apply.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll get this when you or your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age, whichever is later.</p>

<h2 id="inheriting-additional-state-pension">Inheriting Additional State Pension</h2>

<p>You may be able to inherit a portion of your late spouse or civil partner’s <a href="/additional-state-pension/further-information">Additional State Pension</a>. You must have been married or in a civil partnership with your partner before 6 April 2016.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t be able to inherit any of your late spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before State Pension age.</p>
</div>
