You might be able to increase your State Pension depending on when you reach State Pension age.

##You reach State Pension age before 6 April 2016

You may be able to increase your basic State Pension up to £113.1 a week if:

- your own basic State Pension is less than £113.1 a week
- your divorced spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions

You’ll get the increase when you reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).

^You won’t get the increase if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.^

##You reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016

Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.

Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:

- you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate
- you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed

This is also known as the [married women’s reduced rate election](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm) (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).

^Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.^

The Reduced Rate Election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.

**Example**

You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2018. This is in the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018.

You got married in 1975 and chose to to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.

Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in 1982.

##What you may get if you have a reduced rate election

You’ll get a pension that will be about the same as the full rate of the basic State Pension (under the current State Pension system) of £113.1 a week and any Additional State Pension you built up before 6 April 2016.

You’ll get this when you reach State Pension age.

^You won’t need to have the minimum of 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get a State Pension if you’re eligible under these different rules.^

You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

###If you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age

You’ll get a pension that is about the same as the lower rate current system basic State Pension of £67.8 a week and any Additional State Pension you built up before 6 April 2016.

You'll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

^Your pension must have been calculated under the reduced rate election rules for this to apply.^

You’ll get the increase when either you or your former partner reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age), whichever is later.

##Increase your retirement income

You might be able to increase your State Pension amount if:

- you’re eligible for [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits)
- you make [voluntary National Insurance contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions)
- you choose to defer your State Pension
