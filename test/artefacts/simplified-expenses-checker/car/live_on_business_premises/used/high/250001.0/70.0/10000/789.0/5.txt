Based on your answers you would probably be better off working out your expenses based on the actual costs.

These 2 sets of results show what you can claim using each method.

You don’t have to use the same method for different types of expenses. For example, you can use simplified expenses for vehicle costs but work out the actual costs for working from home.

##If you use simplified expenses

You could claim:

- £4,500 for your car or van

^This is an estimate. You should do your own calculations for your tax return.^

**Total to claim per year:** £4,500

- £7,800 to deduct from your total business costs - you then claim the balance

###What to do for your tax return

Use the [simplified expenses flat rates](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-) to work out your business expenses.

Multiply the flat rates with either:

[the miles you drove](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-)
[the hours you worked from home](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/working-from-home)
[the number of people who lived on your business premises](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/living-at-your-business-premises)

##If you work out the actual costs

You could claim:

- £21,800.06 of [capital allowances](/capital-allowances) for your car, van or motorcycle

- £789 to deduct from your total business costs - you then claim the balance

- £14,000.06 for cars, vans and motorcycles

**Total to claim per year:** £14,000.06

The upper limit for Capital Allowance write offs for vans is £250,000.

^This is an estimate. You should do your own calculations for your tax return.^

###What to do for your tax return

You have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premises use.

You then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and [keep records](/self-employed-records) for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills.
