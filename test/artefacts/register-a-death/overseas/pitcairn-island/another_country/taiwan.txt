$!You must register the death according to the regulations in Pitcairn Island. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK (it may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English).

##Register the death with the UK authorities

You can also apply to register the death with the British Trade & Cultural Office in Taiwan.

You don’t have to do this, but it means:

- a British-style death certificate will be issued
- having the death registered at the General Register Office in the UK

##How to register

Download and complete a [registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-death).

##Documents

You must provide originals and a photocopy of:

- a local death certificate (not a certificate issued by a doctor)
- the person’s passport
- their full UK birth, naturalisation or registration certificate (if you can’t provide their passport)
- written permission from the person's next of kin or the ‘executor’ of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

Fill in [form D1, 'Returning the passport of a deceased person'](/government/publications/returning-the-passport-of-a-deceased-person) if you provide their passport.

Fill in [form LS01, 'Lost or Stolen Passport Notification'](/government/publications/lost-or-stolen-passport-notification--2) if the passport is lost or unavailable.
