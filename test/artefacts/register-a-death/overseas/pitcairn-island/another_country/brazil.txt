$!You must register the death according to the regulations in Pitcairn Island. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

This local death certificate will be accepted in the UK (it may need to be a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document) of the document if it’s not in English).

##Register the death with the UK authorities

You can also apply to register the death with the British consulate general in Brazil.

You don’t have to do this, but it means:

- a British-style death certificate will be issued
- having the death registered at the General Register Office in the UK

##How to register

Download and complete a [registration form](/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-death).

##Documents

You must provide originals and a photocopy of:

- a local death certificate (not a certificate issued by a doctor)
- the person’s passport
- their full UK birth, naturalisation or registration certificate (if you can’t provide their passport)
- written permission from the person's next of kin or the ‘executor’ of their estate (if you’re not next of kin or the executor)

Fill in [form D1, 'Returning the passport of a deceased person'](/government/publications/returning-the-passport-of-a-deceased-person) if you provide their passport.

Fill in [form LS01, 'Lost or Stolen Passport Notification'](/government/publications/lost-or-stolen-passport-notification--2) if the passport is lost or unavailable.

You can also post your application to the British consulate general.

Pay by credit or debit card - fill in the [credit card authorisation slip](/government/publications/credit-card-authorization-form) and post it with your registration form.
