$!You must register the death according to the regulations in Iran. You will be given a local death certificate.$!

You can’t currently register the death with the UK authorities.

The local death certificate, with a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document), should be acceptable for all purposes in the UK. You can apply for registration at any time in the future - check [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice) to find out if consular services have reopened in Iran.
