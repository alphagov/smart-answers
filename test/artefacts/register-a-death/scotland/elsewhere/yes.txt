You should register the death within 8 days.

You can go to any [register office](/register-offices) but if you use the one in the area where the person died you’ll be given the documents you’ll need on the day.

If you use a different register office the documents will be sent to the office in the area where the person died before they’re issued to you. This means you’ll usually wait a few days.

^Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.^
