          <p>You should register the death within 5 days.</p>

<p>You can go to any <a href="/register-offices">register office</a> but if you use the one in the area where the person died you’ll be given the documents you’ll need on the day.</p>

<p>If you use a different register office the documents will be sent to the office in the area where the person died before they’re issued to you. This means you’ll usually wait a few days.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="who-can-register-the-death">Who can register the death</h2>

<p>You can register the death if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a relative</li>
  <li>someone present at the death</li>
  <li>the person who found the body</li>
  <li>the person in charge of the body</li>
  <li>the person making arrangements with the funeral directors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you.</p>

<p>If the cause of death is unknown, sudden or unexplained it may be reported to the coroner.</p>

<p>The coroner will give you the documents you need, or they’ll send them direct to the registrar. The table below shows the documents needed.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Cause of death</th>
      <th>Documents issued by coroner</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Natural causes</td>
      <td>Form 100A, or Pink Form 100B if there&rsquo;s a post-mortem - these forms are sent to the  registrar, but sometimes given to you</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unnatural causes/not enough evidence of natural causes</td>
      <td>Order for Burial (form 101) or Certificate for Cremation (form 6) so the funeral can take place – will be given to you; Certificate After Inquest (form 99 (rev)) - this states the cause of death and is sent to the registrar (the death is registered by the registrar with no-one present)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="if-form-100a-or-100b-is-issued-ie-there-is-no-inquest">If form 100A or 100B is issued (ie there is no inquest)</h3>

<p>If available (but don&rsquo;t worry if not), also take the person’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>birth certificate</li>
  <li>marriage or civil partnership certificate</li>
  <li>NHS medical card</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to tell the registrar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the person’s full name at the time of death</li>
  <li>any names previously used, eg maiden name</li>
  <li>the person’s date and place of birth</li>
  <li>their last address</li>
  <li>their occupation</li>
  <li>the full name, date of birth and occupation of a surviving or late spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>whether they were getting a State Pension or any other benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also take supporting documents that show your name and address (eg a utility bill) but you can still register a death without them.</p>

<h2 id="documents-youll-get">Documents you’ll get</h2>

<p>When you register a death you’ll get a Certificate of Registration of Death (form BD8). You may need to fill this out and return it if the person was getting a State Pension or benefits (the form will come with a pre-paid envelope so you know where to send it).</p>

<p>You can buy extra death certificates - these will be needed for <a href="/after-a-death/overview">sorting out the person’s affairs</a>.</p>
