$!The statutory holiday entitlement is 16.8 days holiday.$!


The employer:

* can include bank and public holidays as part of the statutory entitlement
* must not round down the holiday entitlement, but may round it up
* must provide [holiday pay](/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics "Holiday pay") during the statutory leave
* can provide more paid holiday - this will be in the employment contract and is called 'contractual leave entitlement'
