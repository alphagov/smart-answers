Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the flat rate of £7.00 per week. This is an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service would calculate might be different.

This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.  

Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

Payment type | Weekly flat rate payment | Fees | Total amount you’ll receive | Application fee  - you only pay this once
- | -
[Collect and pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £7.00 | £0.28 | £6.72 | £20.00
[Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £7.00 | No fees | £7.00 | £20.00
[Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £7.00 | No fees | £7.00 | No fee

You will pay up to £14.56 in fees per year if you receive child maintenance through the Collect and Pay service.

^You don’t have to pay an application fee if you’re in Northern Ireland.^
