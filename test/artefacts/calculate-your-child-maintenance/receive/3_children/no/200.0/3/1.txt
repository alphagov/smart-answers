Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the basic rate of £27.00 per week.

^This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.^

The calculator gives an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service calculates might be different.
For example, if the paying parent also supports other children, the amount you receive may be less than this.

Payment type | Weekly payment | Fees | Total amount you’ll receive | Application fee  - you only pay this once
- | -
[Collect and Pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £27.00 | £1.08 | £25.92 | £20.00
[Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £27.00 | No fees | £27.00 | £20.00
[Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £27.00 | No fees | £27.00 | No fee

You will pay up to £56.16 in fees per year if you receive child maintenance through the Collect and Pay service.

^You don’t have to pay an application fee if you’re in Northern Ireland.^
