Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the basic rate of £12.00 per week.

This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.

Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

Payment type | Weekly payment | Fees | Total amount you’ll receive | Application fee  - you only pay this once
- | -
[Collect and pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £12.00 | £0.48 | £11.52 | £20.00
[Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £12.00 | No fees | £12.00 | £20.00
[Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £12.00 | No fees | £12.00 | No fee


You will pay up to £24.96 in fees per year if you receive child maintenance through the Collect and Pay service.

^You don’t have to pay an application fee if you’re in Northern Ireland.^


The calculator gives an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service would calculate might be different.
