Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the reduced rate of £12.00 per week.

The calculator gives an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service calculates might be different.

This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.

Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

Payment type | Weekly payment | Additional weekly fees | Total amount to pay per week | Application fee  - you only pay this once

[Collect and pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £12.00 | £2.40 | £14.40 | £20.00
[Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £12.00 | No fees | £12.00 | £20.00
[Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £12.00 | No fees | £12.00 | No fee

You will pay up to £124.80 in fees per year if you pay child maintenance through the Collect and Pay service.
