Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the reduced rate of £7.00 per week.

This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.

Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

Payment type | Weekly payment | Additional weekly fees | Total amount to pay per week | Application fee  - you only pay this once
- | -
[Collect and pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £7.00 | £1.40 | £8.40 | £20.00
[Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £7.00 | No fees | £7.00 | £20.00
[Arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself) | £7.00 | No fees | £7.00 | No fee


You will pay up to £72.80 in fees per year if you pay child maintenance through the Collect and Pay service.

^You don’t have to pay an application fee if you’re in Northern Ireland.^

You may also have to pay an enforcement charge if you don’t make your full payments on time.
