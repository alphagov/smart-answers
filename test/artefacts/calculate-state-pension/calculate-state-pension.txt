Calculate when you’ll reach State Pension age or Pension Credit qualifying age and how much you may get in today’s money for your basic State Pension.

%Get a [State Pension Statement](/state-pension-statement) instead of using this calculator if you're 55 or over and making a financial decision based on [the new pension options](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/).%

##What you need to know:

This calculator gives an estimate of your basic State pension and information about the [new State Pension](/new-state-pension) if you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016.

It doesn’t estimate any [Additional State Pension.](/additional-state-pension)

You’ll be asked for the number of years you worked and paid National Insurance or got certain benefits. These are the years of your [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) that count towards your State Pension.

Count tax years from 6 April to 5 April and don’t count any years twice (eg when you were working and getting benefits). Don’t count the current tax year.

This calculator uses a simplified calculation based on the current law. It can’t take into account every circumstance that might affect you. Don't make future financial decisions based on its results.
