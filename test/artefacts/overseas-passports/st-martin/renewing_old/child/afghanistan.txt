## How long it takes

Your application should take 6 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty's Passport Office in the UK.

You may have to attend an interview.

Applications will take longer if:

- HM Passport Office need to ask you for more information or documents
- the photographs you send are rejected

Don’t book any travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an [Emergency Travel Document](/emergency-travel-document).

## Cost

You’ll have to pay a fee for your passport and a courier fee of £19.86. The courier fee pays for your passport and supporting documents to be sent back to you securely.

| Passport type | Passport fee | Total to pay (including courier fee) |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Child passport | £53.00 | £72.86 |
