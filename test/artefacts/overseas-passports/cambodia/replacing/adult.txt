## How long it takes

Your application will take **at least** 12 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty’s Passport Office in the UK.

If you haven’t already reported the loss or theft, you must include [form LS01](/government/publications/lost-or-stolen-passport-notification--2) with your passport application.

You may have to attend an interview.

Applications will take longer if:

- Her Majesty’s Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents
- the photographs you send are rejected

Don’t book travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an [Emergency Travel Document.](/emergency-travel-document)
