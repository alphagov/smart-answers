##How it’s worked out

Your employee's entitlement is 3.5 weeks.

They get:

+ 0.5 week’s pay for each full year they were under 22
+ 1 week’s pay for each full year they were 22 or older, but under 41
+ 1.5 week’s pay for each full year they were 41 or older

Length of service is capped at 20 years and weekly pay at £430 (£430 In Northern Ireland). Years of service or earnings over these amounts are not included in the calculation.

The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £12,900 (£12,900 In Northern Ireland).

^Redundancy pay under £30,000 is not taxable.^
