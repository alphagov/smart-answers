You may need a visa to work, do business or academic research in the UK.

Whether you need a visa depends on your circumstances.

## Business visits

You don't need a visa if you're coming to the UK for activities allowed under the following visas:

- a [‘permitted paid engagement’](/permitted-paid-engagement-visa) (you must have been invited to the UK because of your expertise) - you can only stay for up to 1 month

However, you should bring [supporting documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) to show at the border.
