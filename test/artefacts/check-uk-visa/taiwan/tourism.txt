You won't need a visa if your passport has a personal ID number on the bio data page.

However, you should bring the [same documents](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) you'd need to apply for a visa, to show to officers at the UK border. 

^If the bio data page in your passport doesn't include a personal ID number, you must [apply for a Short-term Study visa](/study-visit-visa).^
