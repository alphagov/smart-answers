You won't need a visa if your passport has a personal ID number on the bio data page.

However, you should bring the [same documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) you'd need to apply for a visa, to show to officers at the UK border.

^ If the bio data page in your passport doesn't include a personal ID number, you should apply for a [Visitor in Transit](/transit-visa) visa.

## Transiting without a visa

Even if you don't have a personal ID number, you might be eligible for the 'transit without visa concession' if:

- you arrive and depart by air

- have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours

- have the correct documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

One of the following must also apply:

- you’re travelling to (or on part of a reasonable journey to) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country 
- you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country 
- you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa 
- you have a residence permit issued by Australia or New Zealand
- you have a common format residence permit issued by an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland
- you have a residence permit issued by Canada issued after 28 June 2002
- you have a uniform format category D visa for entry to a country in the EEA or Switzerland
- you have an Irish biometric visa and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland
- you’re travelling from the Republic of Ireland and it’s less than 3 months since you were last given permission, on the basis of holding a valid Irish biometric visa, to land or be in Ireland
- you have a valid USA permanent residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998
- you have a valid USA I-551 Temporary Immigrant visa issued by the USA (a wet-ink stamp version will not be accepted)
- you have an expired USA I-551 Permanent Residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998, with a valid I-797 letter authorising extension
- you have a valid standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B issued by the USA (attached to a sealed brown envelope)

You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules. You can apply for a transit visa (/transit-visa) before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa.

E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.

All visas and residence permits must be valid.

Australian paper confirmation slips are not accepted.

^ The 'transit without visa concession' is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You won't be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.
