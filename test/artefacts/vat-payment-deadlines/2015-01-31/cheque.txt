Paying by cheque

You can only pay by cheque if you’re exempt from submitting online VAT returns. If you need to pay by cheque for any other reason, pay by Bank Giro.

The last day you can post your cheque is 19 February 2015.

Your cheque must have cleared by 27 February 2015.

^The date your cheque clears is the day when your payment reach HRMC’s account. It’s not the day when they get your cheque in the post.^
