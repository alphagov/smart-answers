##Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)

Your employee is entitled to SSP for 39 days out of 42 working days taken off sick between  2 April 2018 and  7 July 2018

You don’t have to pay until your employee tells you that they’re ill. You’ll have to pay any withheld amounts by the end of your employee's entitlement to sick pay if your employee is sick for more than 28 weeks.
