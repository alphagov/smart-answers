##What you need to know

^ Your employee will not be able to collect Statutory Paternity Pay or Statutory Adoption Pay while collecting Statutory Sick Pay. ^

SSP can be paid for up to 28 weeks of an employee’s normal workdays. For this employee that equals a total of 56 days. After that you must give them [form SSP1](/employers-sick-pay/eligibility-and-form-ssp1) within 7 days of SSP ending. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance).

There are also [records you must keep](/sick-leave-pay-employees/entitlement) and rules on [proof of illness](/sick-leave-pay-employees/notice-and-fit-notes) you can ask for.
