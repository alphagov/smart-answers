##County court document
Your county court document must have been issued by either the:

- County Court
- Court of Bankruptcy
- Family Division of the High Court of Justice
- High Court of Justice
- Sheriff Court

It can only be legalised if it has either:

- the original seal or ink stamp of the court
- the signature of a court official
- been certified

It can take the Legalisation Office longer to legalise a court document that only has a signature. Getting your document certified might make the process quicker.

##Certifying documents

If you provide a certified document, it must be certified in the UK by a solicitor or ‘notary public’.

When the solicitor or notary public signs the document, they must:

- note the type of certification they have done (eg the document is a true copy of the original)
- use their personal signature, not a company signature
- include the date of certification
- include their company address

If they add a notarial certificate, it must be attached to the document. The certificate must also  contain a specific reference to the document they have certified.

If a notary public from England, Wales or Northern Ireland signs a document for legalisation, they must also stamp or emboss the document with their notarial seal.
