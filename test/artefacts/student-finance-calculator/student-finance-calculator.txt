Student finance calculator

This calculator is for students from England or the European Union (EU) starting a new course in academic years:

+ 2015 to 2016
+ 2016 to 2017

Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

+ student loans
+ extra student funding, eg if you’re disabled or have children

Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

##Before you start

You can’t use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk) or [Northern Ireland.](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk)
