##Student finance

You could get per year:

- £6,000 [Tuition Fee Loan](/studentfinance/continuing-fulltime-students) to pay for your course

- £5,205 [Maintenance Loan](/studentfinance/continuing-fulltime-students) to pay living costs

###Extra student funding

You could get:

- [Social Work Bursary](/social-work-bursaries) (NHS funding towards your fees and living costs)

^Your result is an estimate. Usually, you only get student finance if you’re doing your first higher education qualification - check if you [qualify](/student-finance/who-qualifies).^

##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college.

You might be able to get [help with the costs of travel for study or work placements](/travel-grants-medical-dental-students-england) as part of your course.

Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

^Student loans have to be paid back - bursaries, allowances and grants don’t.^
