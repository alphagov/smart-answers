##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college.

You might be able to get [help with the costs of travel for study or work placements](/travel-grants-medical-dental-students-england) as part of your course.

Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

^Student loans have to be paid back - bursaries, allowances and grants don’t.^
