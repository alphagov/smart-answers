##Tuition costs

You could get a Tuition Fee Loan - £6,000 per year.

The loan pays for the cost of your course and must be paid back.

##Living costs

EU part-time students don't qualify for help with living costs (known as 'maintenance').

##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college. Usually, this doesn't have to be paid back.

Use the [Family Action grant search](http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=21211) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.
