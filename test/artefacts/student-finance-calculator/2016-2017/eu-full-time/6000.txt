##Tuition costs

You could get a [Tuition Fee Loan](/student-finance/eu-students) - £6,000 per year.

The loan pays for the cost of your course and must be paid back.

##Living costs

Most EU full-time students don't qualify for help with living costs (known as 'maintenance').

##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college. Usually, this doesn't have to be paid back.

Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

##Your next steps
