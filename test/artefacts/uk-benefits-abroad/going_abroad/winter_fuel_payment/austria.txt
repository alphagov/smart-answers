You can get the [Winter Fuel Payment](/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility) if you have a genuine link with the UK, eg if you’ve lived and worked in the UK for most of your life.

You must be living in an [European Economic Area (EEA)](/eu-eea) country or Switzerland during the 3rd week of September immediately before the winter you’re claiming the Winter Fuel Payment for.

Contact the [International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to transfer your claim abroad.
