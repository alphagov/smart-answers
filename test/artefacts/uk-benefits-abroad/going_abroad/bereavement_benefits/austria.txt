You can export bereavement benefits to Austria at the same rate as if you were living in the UK.

Claim [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance#how-to-claim), [Bereavement Payment](/bereavement-payment#how-to-claim) or [Widowed Parent's Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance#how-to-claim) before you leave the UK.

Once you have claimed bereavement benefits, [contact the International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to export them.
