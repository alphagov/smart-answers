There is a social security agreement between the UK and Bosnia And Herzegovina. You may be able to get Child Benefit abroad if you (or your spouse if you go with them):

- go to work in Bosnia And Herzegovina
- continue to pay National Insurance contributions

The UK and Bosnia And Herzegovina can count time you spend living or working in the other country when deciding if you qualify for benefits there.

Contact [HMRC](/child-benefit/further-information) to find out how to claim abroad.
