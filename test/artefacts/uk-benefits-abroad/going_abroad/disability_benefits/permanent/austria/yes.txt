You can carry on getting [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance), [Carer's Allowance](/carers-allowance), [PIP](/pip) (daily living component) or Disability Living Allowance (care component) if you have a genuine link to the UK.

The mobility portion of PIP and DLA are not exportable.

Tell the [Exportability Team](/exportability-team) at the Pension, Disability and Carers Service that you're moving abroad.
