You can’t claim [income-based JSA](/jobseekers-allowance/overview) abroad.

You can get [contribution-based JSA](/jobseekers-allowance) for up to 3 months if you're going abroad to look for work and you:

- are entitled to it on the day you go abroad
- register as a jobseeker at least 4 weeks before you leave
- are looking for work in the UK up to the day you leave
- register at the equivalent of a Jobcentre in the country you're going to
- follow the other country's rules on registering and looking for work

Tell your local [Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) that you want to move and get JSA while you're abroad.

You'll  also need to get form U2 from Jobseekers and Benefit Enhancement Section (JBES) which will allow you to register with the unemployment services in the country you're going to.
