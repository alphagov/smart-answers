You can't get JSA while you're abroad. Your [UK National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) may help you qualify for unemployment benefits because of the UK's social security agreements with Guernsey.

Ask the authorities in Guernsey about any benefits you might be entitled to.

*[JSA]: Jobseeker's Allowance
