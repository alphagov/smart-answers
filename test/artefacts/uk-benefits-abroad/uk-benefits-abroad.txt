UK benefits if you're going or living abroad

Find out which UK benefits you might be able to get while you're abroad and how to claim them.

The UK has social security agreements with some countries that:

- allow you to claim UK contribution-based benefits while you're there
- mean that your National Insurance contributions can count towards your eligibility for that country's benefits

It's easier to organise benefits before you leave.

^You must meet the benefit's eligibility criteria to get it.^
