You can get [Winter Fuel Payments](/winter-fuel-payment) while you’re abroad if you have a genuine link with the UK, eg if you’ve lived and worked in the UK for most of your life.

You must be living in an [EEA country](/eu-eea) or Switzerland during the 3rd week of September immediately before the winter you’re claiming the Winter Fuel Payment for.  

Contact the [International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to set up your claim.
