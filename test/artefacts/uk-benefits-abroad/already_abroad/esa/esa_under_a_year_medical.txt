You can't start getting ESA while temporarily abroad.

You can carry on getting [income-related or contribution-based ESA](/employment-support-allowance) for up to 26 weeks after leaving the UK if you were already receiving it before you left and the medical treatment is for the disease or disability for which you're getting ESA.

You must have told your local [Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) before you left.

There is no 26 week limit for NHS-funded treatment abroad.

You may be able to get benefits if you've been paying into a local security insurance scheme. Contact the local authorities to find out more.
