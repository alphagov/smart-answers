You can't start getting ESA while temporarily abroad.

You can carry on getting [income-related or contribution-based ESA](/employment-support-allowance) for up to 4 weeks after you leave the UK if you were already receiving it before you left.

You may able to get ESA for a longer temporary absence if you're the family member of a Crown servant - someone who works for the UK government abroad.

Tell your local [Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) before you go.
