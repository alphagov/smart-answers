Marriage in New Zealand


Contact the [High Commission of New Zealand](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for New Zealand](/foreign-travel-advice/new-zealand) before making any plans.


The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


*[CNI]:certificate of no impediment
