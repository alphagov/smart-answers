Civil partnership in Finland

Same-sex relationships in Finland that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ’rekisteröity parisuhde’, or ’registrerad partnerskap’ (’registered partnership’).


Contact the relevant local authorities in Finland to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.


##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Finland.

Contact the local British embassy or consulate where you’re planning the ceremony to find out what you need to do.
