Marriage in Indonesia

Make an appointment at the British Embassy in Jakarta to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

Before the appointment you’ll need to pay a fee to the British Embassy in Jakarta. You can do this by credit card or in cash in the local currency. You also need to complete 2 copies of the [‘Affidavit for marriage’ form](/government/publications/marriage-in-indonesia).

Send one copy to the British Embassy in Jakarta by email or post. Take the other one with you when you go to your local appointment, along with your passport.

^Allow the embassy at least 2 days to process your paperwork before turning up for your appointment.^
