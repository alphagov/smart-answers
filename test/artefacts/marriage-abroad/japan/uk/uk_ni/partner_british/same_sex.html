<h2 id="what-documents-youll-need">What documents you’ll need</h2>

<p>You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days. You and your partner will need to sign a declaration and provide proof of residence eg, an employer’s letter or a bank statement.</p>

<p>You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a></li>
  <li>the <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>Once you’ve made your appointment, the embassy or consulate will give you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a notice of registration</li>
  <li>a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (read the fees table on this page), the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.</p>

<p>As long as nobody registers an objection during the 14 days, the registration officer can then register your marriage or partnership any time until 3 months after you gave notice.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide 2 witnesses and pay a fee to register your marriage or civil partnership. You’ll need to pay an additional fee for your marriage or civil partnership certificate (read the fees table on this page).</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="naturalisation-of-your-partner-if-they-move-to-the-uk">Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK</h2>

<p>Your partner can apply to <a href="/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen">become a British citizen</a> once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.</p>
