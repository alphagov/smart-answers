##What you need to do

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/russia/uk/partner_british/opposite_sex)
- [go to Russia and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/russia/ceremony_country/partner_british/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Russia, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
