^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Brunei](/foreign-travel-advice/brunei) before making any plans.


The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


^You must get married through an Islamic ceremony in Brunei if you or your partner is a Muslim. Otherwise, you’ll need to have a civil marriage.^
