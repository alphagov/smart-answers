Marriage in Germany

Contact the relevant local authorities in Germany (registry office ‘standesamt’ or church)  to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Germany](/foreign-travel-advice/germany) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You don’t need a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry if you’re a British national resident outside of the UK. However, you’ll need to apply for an exemption (‘Befreiung von der Beibringung des Ehefähigkeitszeugnisses’) from the Higher Regional Court (‘Oberlandesgericht’) in the region where you want to marry.

Contact the local registry office (‘Standesamt’) where you’re getting married - they'll tell you what you need to do.

If the Standesamt does ask you for a CNI (‘Ehefähigkeitszeugnis’), refer them to the relevant part of the [German Civil Code](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1309.html) (‘Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch’).

You’ll need to complete a statutory declaration at the registry office as part of the application process.
