Marriage in Egypt

Contact the relevant local authorities in Egypt to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Egypt](/foreign-travel-advice/egypt) before making any plans.


##What you need to do


Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate in Egypt to make a declaration that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.
