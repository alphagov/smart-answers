Civil Partnership in Canada

Same-sex relationships in Canada that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’union de fait’, or ’common-law relationship’ (in Manitoba)
- ’domestic partnership’ (in Nova Scotia)
- ’union civile’, or ’civil union’ (in Quebec)


Contact the relevant local authorities in Canada to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.
