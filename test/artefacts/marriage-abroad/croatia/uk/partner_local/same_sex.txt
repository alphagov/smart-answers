##What documents you’ll need

You’ll need proof that you’ve been resident in the area covered by the British embassy or consulate for at least 7 days, like an employer’s letter or a bank statement.


You’ll both need your original passports. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order), or
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)


Your partner will also need either:

- a ‘certificate of no impediment’ (CNI) or similar document to prove they’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership from their national authorities
- an official letter from the local authorities in the country where they’re resident confirming that they’re single

^Any foreign documents may need to be ’[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) in the country they were issued (or that country’s embassy in Croatia), and [translated into English](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers).^


###What you need to do

Once you’ve made your appointment, the British embassy or consulate will give you:

- a notice of registration
- a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to enter into a civil partnership

Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee (see below), the British embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody has registered an objection after this time, the registration officer can then register your partnership any time until 3 months after the date you gave notice.

You’ll need to provide two witnesses and pay a fee to register your civil partnership. You’ll need to pay an additional fee for your civil partnership certificate (see below).


##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
