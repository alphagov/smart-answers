Marriage in Jordan

Contact the [Embassy of Jordan](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^There are no civil marriages in Jordan, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Jordan](/foreign-travel-advice/jordan) before making any plans.


##What you need to do


You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days.

If you’re getting married at the Sharia Court, you’ll need to provide a [single declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-jordan) to prove you’re allowed to marry, or a [single divorced declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-if-you-are-divorced-jordan) if you’re divorced.

Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

For non-Islamic marriages, you may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).


^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Jordan to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^


They’ll post your notice, and as long as nobody has registered an objection after 14 days, they’ll issue your CNI.

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in Jordan at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.

You should also check if it needs to be:


- ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046)

You should also check with the local authorities in Jordan to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%


##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
