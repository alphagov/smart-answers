Marriage in Jordan

Contact the relevant local authorities in Jordan to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^There are no civil marriages in Jordan, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You may be able to get married at the British Embassy if you’re both resident in Jordan and can prove that there are no other suitable facilities.

Contact the British Embassy in Jordan for more information.



^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^


##What you need to do


You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days.

If you’re getting married at the Sharia Court, you’ll need to provide a [single declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-jordan) to prove you’re allowed to marry, or a [single divorced declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-if-you-are-divorced-jordan) if you’re divorced.

Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring the single declaration, your passport, your partner’s passport and pay a fee.

^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

For non-Islamic marriages, you’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.


To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Jordan. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner


^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^


If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [single divorced declaration document](/government/publications/single-declaration-form-for-islamic-marriages-if-you-are-divorced-jordan) if you’re getting married at the Sharia Court
- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^


You’ll need to fill in forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.



%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Jordan.


^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
