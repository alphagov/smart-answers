Marriage in the United Arab Emirates


Contact the [Embassy of the United Arab Emirates](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the United Arab Emirates](/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates) before making any plans.


^There are no civil marriages in the United Arab Emirates, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You can only get married in the United Arab Emirates if you or your partner are resident there.

##What you need to do

You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days.

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the United Arab Emirates to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

^If you have dual nationality and you entered the United Arab Emirates on a non-British passport, you must contact the embassy of that country to get your affirmation or affidavit.^

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^


### What you need to take

You’ll need to take all of the following to your appointment:

- your completed and typed affirmation or affidavit – you’ll be sent the form by email after booking your appointment
- your passport and UAE residency or entry visa
- the residency visa/UAE entry stamp in your partner’s passport if they’re resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a copy of your partner’s passport or ID if they aren’t resident in the United Arab Emirates
- proof of full residential address such as a utility bill, eg DEWA bill, rental contract, title deed

If your rental contract is in your company’s name, you need to take both of the following:

- a letter from your company stating your home address and confirming that they’re providing you with accommodation
- a copy of the tenancy contract

If you’re living with your parents or a friend, you need to take both of the following:

- a letter from the holder of the tenancy contract stating that you’re living in that property
- a copy of the tenancy holder’s passport and a copy of the tenancy contract

^A marriage affirmation or affidavit is valid for 3 months.^

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.




If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)


You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.



^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
