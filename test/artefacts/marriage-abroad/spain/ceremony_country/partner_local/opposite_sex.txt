Marriage in Spain

Contact the relevant local authorities in Spain to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

Civil weddings in Spain take place at a town hall, register office or district court. You must register with the local civil authorities afterwards to get an official marriage certificate if you have a religious wedding.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI), marital status certificate or both to prove you’re allowed to marry.

^Document requirements vary across Spain - check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re getting married to find out what you’ll need.^

Your partner must also provide their own certificates.

You must apply for all certificates at least 3 months before you get married.

## Getting a certificate of no impediment

Download and complete the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/certificate-of-no-impediment-application-pack) - it contains a list of the documents you’ll need.

You must sign the notice of marriage and affirmation in front of a local [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) in Spain before you send your application to the consulate.

Send all the documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

###What happens next

The consulate will check your forms and documents. Once everything is approved, they’ll take your payment and display your notice of marriage for 7 days. If nobody raises an objection, they’ll then issue your CNI and send it to you with your original documents by registered post.

It takes 10 working days after payment for the consulate to process your application.

##Other requirements for Spain

If you’ve been living in Spain for less than 2 years, the civil registrar may also ask for confirmation of your addresses for the past 2 years (‘confirmación de domicilio para casarse en España’).

You’ll need to show one of the following:

- a letter confirming your address, eg electoral roll
- a bank or building society statement, credit card statement
- a mortgage statement
- a council tax letter
- utility bills
- recent proof of entitlement to local or state benefits, eg tax credits, pension, education or other benefits

If you’re asked to provide a document from the British consulate, print out a copy of the [‘communication proof of address’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/communication-regarding-proof-of-address-spain).

^You must get your documents translated if they’re not in English or Spanish.^

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
