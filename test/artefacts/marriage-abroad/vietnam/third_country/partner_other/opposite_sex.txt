Marriage in Vietnam

Contact the relevant local authorities in Vietnam to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Vietnam](/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam) before making any plans.


##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Vietnam to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

###Legalisation and translation


You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.


If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)


- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.


You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.


^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^


##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
