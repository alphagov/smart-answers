          <p>Contact the local comune (town hall) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>You’ll be asked to provide a ‘Nulla Osta’ by the authorities in Italy. This is a certificate that proves you’re allowed to marry.</p>

<p>To get a Nulla Osta, you’ll first need to give notice of your intended marriage at the British Embassy in Rome.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-a-nulla-osta-from-the-embassy">Applying for a Nulla Osta from the embassy</h3>

<p>You’ll need to have been living in Italy for 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.. You can then book an appointment at the British Embassy in Rome.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>your <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">full birth certificate</a> or <a href="/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate">naturalisation certificate</a> which states both of your parents’ names</li>
  <li>proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy or notary public to find out what you need</li>
  <li>equivalent documents for your partner</li>
</ul>

<p>You and your partner will need to provide your passports and <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">full birth certificate</a> or <a href="/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate">naturalisation certificate</a>.</p>

<p>If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="/copy-decree-absolute-final-order">decree absolute or final order</a></li>
  <li>a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate</li>
  <li>your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/">death certificate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it <a href="/government/collections/list-of-lawyers">translated</a> if it’s not in English.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a woman you must wait 300 days after divorcing or the death of your husband before remarrying.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to fill in forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry.</p>

<p>You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2">Download ‘Notice of marriage’</a></p>

<p><a href="/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form">Download ‘Affidavit for marriage’</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h3>

<p>The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.</p>

<p>If you give notice at a notary public, you must post the signed forms and any supporting documents to your nearest British embassy or consulate afterwards.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The embassy or consulate may charge a fee to return your documents to you.</p>
</div>

<p>The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.</p>

<p>They’ll then send all of your documentation to the British embassy or consulate nearest to where you’re getting married in Italy, who will issue your <abbr title="certificate of no impediment">CNI</abbr> (as long as nobody has registered an objection).</p>

<p>There’s an additional fee for this - the embassy or consulate will contact you to arrange payment.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).</p>
</div>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.</p>
