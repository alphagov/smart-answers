Marriage in South Africa


Contact the relevant local authorities in South Africa to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^


The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


%You’ll probably be asked for a CNI if you want to marry a South African citizen in South Africa. You’ll need to ask if there are any other documents the authorities will accept instead.%
