Marriage in Cyprus


Contact the relevant local authorities in Cyprus to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^


The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


###Other requirements for Cyprus

You must provide evidence that you’re allowed to marry if you’re resident in Cyprus but you’ve been there for less than 3 years. However, the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/) (GRO) in the UK can only provide letters covering a specified 3-year period, not including the most recent 18 months.

You should [contact the municipality](http://www.ucm.org.cy/Account_List.aspx) in the area of Cyprus where you’d like to marry to check if they’ll accept this.


##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
