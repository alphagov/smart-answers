There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/uzbekistan/uk/partner_other/opposite_sex)
- [go to Uzbekistan and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/uzbekistan/ceremony_country/partner_other/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Uzbekistan, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
