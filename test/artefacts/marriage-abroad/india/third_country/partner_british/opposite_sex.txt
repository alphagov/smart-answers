Marriage in India


Contact the relevant local authorities in India to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for India](/foreign-travel-advice/india) before making any plans.


The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


The British High Commission in India can provide you with a letter explaining this position for a charge - see [consular fees for India](/government/publications/india-consular-fees).
