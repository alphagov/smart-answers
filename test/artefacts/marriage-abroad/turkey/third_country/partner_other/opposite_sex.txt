Marriage in Turkey


Contact the relevant local authorities in Turkey to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Turkey](/foreign-travel-advice/turkey) before making any plans.



##What you need to do


Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Turkey to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

You’ll need to complete an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ form that will be used for your affidavit. Take the completed form with you to your appointment.

You’ll need to get your affidavit ‘[legalised](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) before you travel to Turkey.


If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll




^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

Once the document is legalised you’ll need to have it checked at the local marriage office nearest to where your marriage will take place.
