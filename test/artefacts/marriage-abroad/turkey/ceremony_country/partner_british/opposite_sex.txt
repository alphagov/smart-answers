Marriage in Turkey

Contact the relevant local authorities in Turkey to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^


##What you need to do


Make an appointment at the local British embassy or consulate in Turkey to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

You’ll need to get your affidavit ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities, this is usually done on the same day - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.


If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll


^Your partner will need to get an affirmation as well.^
