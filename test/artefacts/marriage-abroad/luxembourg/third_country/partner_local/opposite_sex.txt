##What you need to do


You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to Luxembourg and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/luxembourg/ceremony_country/partner_local/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Luxembourg, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
