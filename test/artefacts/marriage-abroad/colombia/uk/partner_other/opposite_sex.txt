Marriage in Colombia

Contact the [Embassy of Colombia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Colombia](/foreign-travel-advice/colombia) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy in Bogota to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee of £55.

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Colombia](/government/publications/colombia-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
