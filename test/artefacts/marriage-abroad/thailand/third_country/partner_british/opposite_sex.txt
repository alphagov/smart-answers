Marriage in Thailand


Contact the relevant local authorities in Thailand to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Thailand](/foreign-travel-advice/thailand) before making any plans.

%You must register your marriage at an amphur office (district office) in Thailand - a religious ceremony on its own won’t be valid.%

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Thailand to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Bangkok.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-bangkok/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You can prepare the affirmation in advance using a [template](/government/publications/information-for-british-nationals-intending-to-marry-in-thailand). You must type this out and take it with you to your appointment.

^Your partner will need to get an affirmation as well.^

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/16265-Naturalization-Legalization.html) in Thailand.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need the original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/).
Documents issued outside the UK or Thailand must be certified by the country’s embassy in Thailand, and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if they’re not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation as well.^
