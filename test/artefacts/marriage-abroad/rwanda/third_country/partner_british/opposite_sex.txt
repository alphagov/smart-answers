Marriage in Rwanda

Contact the relevant local authorities in Rwanda to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Rwanda](/foreign-travel-advice/rwanda) before making any plans.

There aren’t any British consular facilities to register a marriage or get legal documents to prove you’re eligible to marry in Rwanda.

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Rwanda](/government/publications/rwanda-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.
