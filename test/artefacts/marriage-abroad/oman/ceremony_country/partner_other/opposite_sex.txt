Marriage in Oman

Contact the relevant local authorities in Oman to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^There are no civil marriages in Oman, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You may be able to get married at the British Embassy if you’re both resident in Oman and can prove that there are no other suitable facilities.

Contact the British Embassy in Oman for more information.



^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^


##What you need to do


You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 full days.

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.


To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Oman. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner


If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)


^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.^


You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.



%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%




###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.



You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Oman.


^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^


##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
