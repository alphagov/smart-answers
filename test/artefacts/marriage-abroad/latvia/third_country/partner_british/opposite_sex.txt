##What you need to do


You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.


There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/latvia/uk/partner_british/opposite_sex)
- [go to Latvia and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/latvia/ceremony_country/partner_british/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Latvia, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
