Marriage in Latvia

Contact the relevant local authorities in Latvia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Latvia](/foreign-travel-advice/latvia) before making any plans.


##What you need to do


You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/latvia/uk/partner_local/opposite_sex)
- [go to Latvia and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/latvia/ceremony_country/partner_local/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Latvia, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
