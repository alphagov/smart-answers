Marriage in Morocco


Contact the relevant local authorities in Morocco to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You also need to contact the Marriage Officer (Laadoul) in the city where you are going to get married.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Morocco](/foreign-travel-advice/morocco) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Morocco to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

^An ’affirmation for marriage’ document issued in Morocco is valid for 3 months.^

Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.
