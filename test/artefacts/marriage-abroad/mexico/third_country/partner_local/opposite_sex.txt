^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Mexico](/foreign-travel-advice/mexico) before making any plans.


##What you need to do


You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.


There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/mexico/uk/partner_local/opposite_sex)
- [go to Mexico and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/mexico/ceremony_country/partner_local/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Mexico, you’ll normally have to wait at least 10 days before you can get married.%
