Marriage in the Philippines


Contact the relevant local authorities in the Philippines to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the Philippines to swear an affirmation or affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Manila.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-manila/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

You’ll need to complete an [affirmation for marriage](/government/publications/marriage-in-the-philippines) (non-religious) form or an [affidavit for marriage](/government/publications/marriage-in-the-philippines) (religious) form.

You must download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance. It must be typed on a computer and printed.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your affirmation or affidavit
- your passport

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) - you’ll need to get the document [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English (bring the original and English translation with you)
- the original marriage certificate, Advisory of Marriage and court documents (if the previous marriage was annulled in the Philippines)
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

##What happens next

You can usually get your affirmation or affidavit on the day of your appointment if you have all your supporting documents.

Once you have your affirmation or affidavit, you can apply for a marriage licence from the local civil registrar. 

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
