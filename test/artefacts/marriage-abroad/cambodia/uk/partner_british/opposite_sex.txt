Marriage in Cambodia


Contact the [Embassy of Cambodia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.




##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.


Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Cambodia to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

You’ll need to pay a fee and bring the following to your appointment:

- your passport
- your [birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof of residence, eg a residence certificate - check with the embassy or consulate for advice


###Legalisation and translation

You might need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.




If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.




^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation as well.^
