Marriage in China


Contact the relevant local authorities in China to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for China](/foreign-travel-advice/china) before making any plans.




##What you need to do


Make an appointment at your local British embassy or consulate in China to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.
