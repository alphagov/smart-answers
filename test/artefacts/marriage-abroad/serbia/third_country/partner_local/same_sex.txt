##What documents you’ll need

You need to have been living in the country where you intend to marry for 21 days. You and your partner will need to sign a declaration and provide proof of residence eg, an employer’s letter or a bank statement.

You’ll both need your original passports. You’ll also need evidence that your partner is free to marry - a document from their government or their passport that says they are unmarried. If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

##What you need to do

Once you’ve made your appointment, the embassy or consulate will give you:

- a notice of registration
- a declaration that you and your partner will need to swear, stating that you’re legally entitled to marry

Once you’ve submitted these and paid the registration fee, the embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody registers an objection during the 14 days, the registration officer can then register your marriage any time until 3 months after you gave notice.

You’ll need to provide two witnesses and pay a fee to register your marriage. You’ll need to pay an additional fee for your marriage certificate.

^All same-sex marriages must take place under English and Welsh or Scottish law even if you live in or are from Northern Ireland. Tell the embassy or consulate which law you want to get married under at your appointment.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

##Fees

Service | Fee
-|-

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for Serbia](/government/publications/serbia-consular-fees).

You can pay by cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

##Convert a civil partnership to a same-sex marriage

If you’ve already entered into a civil partnership you may be able to convert it to a same-sex marriage - read [‘Convert a civil partnership to a same-sex marriage abroad’](/convert-civil-partnership-abroad).
