##Civil partnership in Greece

Contact the [Embassy of Greece](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) or the relevant authorities in Greece (town hall or local Greek [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/)) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should get [legal advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Greece](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece) before making any plans.^

You will need to provide proof of residence, for example, a residence permit, a utility statement or property ownership.

##What you need to do

The local [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) in Greece will prepare a cohabitation agreement. You’ll need to sign it with your partner in front of the notary.

You’ll also need to get the documentation [interpreted](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/translators-and-interpreters-list) if you don’t speak Greek.

You’ll both need your current passports or national identity cards.

Once the agreement has been signed, you’ll need to register the agreement with the local town hall. The registrar will then issue you with a special registration certificate.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
