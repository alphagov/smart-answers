$!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

If you're still getting Disability Living Allowance (DLA), when you'll be invited to claim PIP depends on:

- when your DLA ends
- your postcode area
- if your care and mobility needs change

###Your DLA ends before September 2017

You'll be told 20 weeks before your DLA ends and invited to claim PIP in most areas.

You'll also be invited to claim PIP if you tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that your care or mobility needs have changed.


###Your DLA ends after September 2017 or your DLA award has no end date

Some people will be invited to claim PIP from 13 July 2015 if you live in the following areas:

- Blackburn (BB)
- Bolton (BL)
- Derby (DE)
- Leicester (LE)
- Manchester (M)
- Oldham (OL)
- Preston (PR)
- Stoke-on-Trent (ST)
- Warrington (WA)
- Wigan (WN)

On 17 August 2015 the scheme will be expanded to include postcodes beginning with:

- Colchester (CO)
- Liverpool (L)
- Norwich (NR)

This includes if you have an indefinite or long-term awards of DLA.

^You can be contacted anytime between 13 July 2015 and 30 September 2017. Not everyone in these postcode areas will be contacted to claim PIP right away.^

You'll continue to get DLA until DWP writes to you about when it will end.
