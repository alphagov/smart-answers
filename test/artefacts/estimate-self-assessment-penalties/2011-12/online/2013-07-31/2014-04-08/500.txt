<p>Your penalty can be up to 100% of your tax bill if you deliberately don’t pay it.</p>

<p>These figures are estimates based on the figures you gave. The total is rounded down to the nearest pound.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t have to pay any penalties unless you&rsquo;re asked to by HMRC. The amount that HMRC asks for might be different than this estimate.</p>
