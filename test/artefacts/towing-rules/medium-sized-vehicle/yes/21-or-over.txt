You can tow trailers up to 750 kg with a standard C1 medium-sized vehicle licence as long as the towing vehicle weight isn’t more than 7,500 kg.

If you want to tow heavier trailers you’ll need to apply for provisional C1+E entitlement then pass the C1+E test.

This will let you can tow vehicle and trailer combinations up to 12,000 kg. The fully loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle.
