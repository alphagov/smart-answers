You already have the C1+E towing with a medium-sized vehicle entitlement on your licence.

This means you can tow trailers weighing more than 750kg with a C1 medium-sized vehicle. The total weight of the vehicle and trailer can’t be more than 12,000kg and the fully-loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle weight.
