You’re too young to tow with a category C1 medium-sized vehicle.

You have to wait until you’re 18 to get a C1 licence, which will let you tow trailers up to 750 kg as long as the combined vehicle and trailer weight isn’t more than 7,500 kg.

To tow heavier trailers you’ll then need to get the C1+E towing entitlement. There are restrictions on this until you’re 21.
