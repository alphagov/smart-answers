You can’t normally drive or tow with a minibus until you’re 21. You then need to first take the D1 minibus test to tow trailers up to 750 kg. To tow heavier trailers you’ll then need to take the D1+E towing test.

##Driving and towing with a minibus at 18

In some cases you can drive and tow with a minibus at 18 if you’re taking or have passed a PCV test or Driver CPC. See the [guide to Driver CPC](/driver-certificate-of-professional-competence-cpc) for more information.

*[Driver CPC]: Driver Certificate of Professional Competence
*[PCV]: Passenger Carrying Vehicle
