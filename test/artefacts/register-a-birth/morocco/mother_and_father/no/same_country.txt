You must send the original copies of:

- the child’s full local birth certificate - it must have both parents’ names
- a [name confirmation form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/birth-registration-name-confirmation-form) that says how you would like the child's full name to be registered, if the name differs from the name on the local birth certificate

- the long version of the parent’s birth certificate showing the child’s grandparents’ details (for parents who were born in the UK)
- the parent’s naturalisation or registration certificate (for parents who weren’t born in the UK)
- the parents’ marriage or civil partnership certificate (if applicable)
- evidence that the parents’ previous marriages or civil partnerships have ended (eg divorce or death certificates)
- change of name documents (if either parent has ever changed their name)
- a letter from the parent’s employer if they’re working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)
- written evidence if the parent was born overseas while one of their own parents was working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)

You must also send photocopies of:
