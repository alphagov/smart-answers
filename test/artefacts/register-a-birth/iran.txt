$!You must register the birth according to the regulations in Iran.$!

You can’t currently register the birth with the UK authorities.

The local birth certificate, with a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document), should be acceptable for all purposes in the UK. You can apply for registration at any time in the future - check [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice) to find out if consular services have reopened in Iran.
