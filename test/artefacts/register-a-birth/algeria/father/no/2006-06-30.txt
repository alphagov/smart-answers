$!You must register the birth according to the regulations in Algeria.$!

You can’t usually register your child’s birth with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Overseas Registration Unit. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) for the child.

You may however be able to register the birth if either:

- you’ve married the other parent since the child was born (depending on where the father was considered to be permanently living at the time of the birth)
- the country where the father was considered to be permanently living at the time of the birth did not distinguish between married and unmarried parents

Contact the Overseas Registration Unit for advice at <birthregistrationenquiries@fco.gov.uk>.
