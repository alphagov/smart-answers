$!You must register the birth in the country where the child was born. You'll be given a local birth certificate.$!


You can also register the birth with the UK authorities.

^It’s usually quicker to register the birth with the UK authorities if you [get a British passport](/overseas-passports) for the child first. You can’t apply for a passport in Libya but you can apply in a neighbouring country.^

To register the birth with the UK authorities you must:

s1. Check that you have the right documents.
s2. Print out and fill in the birth registration form.
s3. Pay.
s4. Post your documents and the form.


##1. Check your documents

^Send English translations of all foreign documents. Use a professional translator and include their name and address with your application. Don't send laminated documents.^


You must send the original copies of:

- the child’s full local birth certificate - it must have both parents' names

- the long version of the parent’s birth certificate showing the child’s grandparents’ details (for parents who were born in the UK)
- the parent’s naturalisation or registration certificate (for parents who weren’t born in the UK)
- the parents’ marriage or civil partnership certificate (if applicable)
- evidence that the parents’ previous marriages or civil partnerships have ended (eg divorce or death certificates)
- change of name documents (if either parent has ever changed their name)
- a letter from the parent’s employer if they’re working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)
- written evidence if the parent was born overseas while one of their own parents was working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)

You must also send photocopies of:

- the photo page of the child’s British passport if they have one
- the photo page of the parent’s current passport (for British parents)
- the birth certificate or the photo page of the parent’s current passport (for parents who aren’t British)

If the child doesn't have a British passport you must also send the original copies of:

- a Certificate of No Marriage ("Cenomar") issued by the National Statistics Office (NSO) or Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) - if the Filipino mother is single
- an Advisory on Marriage certificate issued by the NSO or PSA - if the Filipino mother is married

- immunisation and vaccination cards
- a letter from the hospital confirming the birth
- receipts from the hospital for the birth and any medical treatment (if any)
- photos of the child as a baby, in which the child can clearly be identified with its parents in the Philippines
- photos of the child growing up in the Philippines with its parents and any siblings
- the parents' wedding photos (if the parents have been married)
- photos of the mother during pregnancy (if the mother is a British citizen)

%Your application will be rejected if the documents aren’t authentic, don’t confirm the child’s identity or don’t prove that the child has a claim to British nationality. The registration fee won’t be refunded.%
